					<description><![CDATA[I have been thinking of buying a lot of coffee cup pods that I can use in the morning before I go to work and I am glad that I found this article because I had no idea that there are so many benefits! You make a great point that coffee can help you to burn fat because it boosts your metabolism. This would be great for me because I am trying to lose weight. Also, the fact that coffee provides important nutrients like potassium and magnesium is great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like how you say that you should drink coffee right before you exercise so that you can get a boost in performance. Maybe gyms should have some there then for those people who are working out. They&#039;d need to find someone to deliver coffee for them though.]]></description>

Tatiana, 

Instant coffee is processed more and processing generally strips food of its health properties to some degree, so it&#039;s going to have less of the good stuff. It will still provide you with the same levels of caffeine, which can help workout performance, but it won&#039;t have as much as some of the other health benefits.]]></description>

Hey Zarak, Having to pee 20 times a day, if you are not exaggerating, is not normal. Perhaps you should try cutting back to see if that relieves the problem. Some people can&#039;t handle diuretics as well as others.]]></description>
