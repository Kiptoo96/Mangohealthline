It has been used for centuries to heal colds, acid reflux, and allergies. But is apple cider vinegar for weight loss really a trick to help you shed unwanted pounds?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of studies on ACV and losing weight out there to give us an idea if it\u2019s a good addition to your <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">weight-loss plan. <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that, regardless of how awesome a supplement is, <strong>a healthy diet and proper exercise are an important part of obtaining your goal.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2qSGxpo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Apple Cider Vinegar<\/a> is fermented apple cider, and it\u2019s loaded with enzymes that promote health. This makes it a wonderful supplement for health in general, but is drinking vinegar that burns when it goes down worth it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We checked out some of the more popular rumors and looked into what the science has to say about them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar Reduces Belly Fat<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of reasons why we get a little extra jiggle around our middle. It can be caused by hormonal changes, certain types of medications, health issues like <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-weight-with-hypothyroidism\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thyroid disease<\/a> or leaky gut, age, or genetics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/gallery\/0,,20807507,00.html#belly-fat-blues-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">excess belly fat<\/a> happens because we\u2019ve been sneaking a few too many sweet treats on our work break or doubling up on the pasta.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever might be causing it, sometimes it\u2019s hard to get rid of, even when we\u2019re sticking to our diet plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Japanese research team did a 12-week study to see if drinking ACV had any impact on weight loss. <strong>They found that participants who took 30 milliliters a day (less than half an ounce) had a decrease in weight, body mass index, and belly fat. <\/strong>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1271\/bbb.90231\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They believe its ability to fight weight around the middle comes from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.livestrong.com\/article\/467468-what-are-the-health-benefits-of-acetic-acid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acetic acid<\/a> in it, which is also responsible for its unique flavor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While they only lost an average of two to four pounds, the fact that they didn\u2019t make any other changes to their lifestyle or diet means that it does work a little bit. Most of us will take a two-pound loss any day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>It Makes You Feel Fuller<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to weight gain, sometimes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellfit.com\/proper-food-portion-sizes-for-weight-loss-3495475\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portion size<\/a> is a culprit. If you eat out a lot, you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A study was done to see if the acetic acid in <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2qSGxpo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">apple cider vinegar<\/a> could make participants feel more satiated after a meal. <strong>Acetic acid impacts glucose levels and insulin<\/strong>, so the researchers gave every participant a piece of bread, along with different doses of acetic acid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ones who had the highest dose felt the fullest, so the researchers concluded that ACV can be used as an appetite suppressant. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/1602197\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a catch, though; <strong>the only way to get the benefits is to take it on an empty stomach, which can make your belly nauseous.<\/strong> You can use it to make yourself feel fuller, but it\u2019s probably not the best option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar is Good for Gut Health<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/apple-cider-vinegar-health-benefits.jpg\" alt=\"apple cider vinegar health benefits\" class=\"wp-image-25102\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/apple-cider-vinegar-health-benefits.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/apple-cider-vinegar-health-benefits-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/apple-cider-vinegar-health-benefits-365x244.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/apple-cider-vinegar-health-benefits-355x237.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to lose weight, you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/healed-leaky-gut-ibs-in-2-months\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">keep your gut healthy<\/a> by maintaining a balance of good and bad bacteria in the gastrointestinal system. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar-and-cranberry-juice\/\">Apple cider vinegar<\/a> is a prebiotic<\/strong>, so it helps maintain the beneficial gut bacteria. (<a href=\"https:\/\/drjockers.com\/rebuild-gut-flora-metabolism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People often get probiotics and prebiotics confused. Probiotic foods and supplements contain beneficial gut bacteria, while prebiotics are made up of carbs that your body can\u2019t digest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good gut bacteria love to eat these carbs, which keep them healthy and flourishing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The amounts of good and bad bacteria in your belly have a lot to do with your<\/strong> metabolism and ability to gain or lose weight. They control how many calories you absorb, cause food cravings, and produce certain types of fatty acids that boost the immune system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2qSGxpo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Apple Cider Vinegar<\/a> will help your system digest food and absorb nutrients, which helps with weight loss, but it can\u2019t do it alone. It\u2019s suggested that having ACV with fermented foods or a probiotic supplement increases its weight-busting properties.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>It Can Help Get Rid of Candida Overgrowth<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have a sweet tooth, white bread, or pasta addiction? Chances are you\u2019ve got too much candida, also known as yeast, in your system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Too much yeast can cause these cravings, along with digestive issues, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/unhealthy-gut-warning-signs\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poor gut health<\/a>, and many other health issues. The yeast feeds off these types of carbs, which causes your blood sugar to drop and makes you crave more of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s a vicious cycle and one that can cause serious weight gain<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/candida-diet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Candida overgrowth<\/a> can also mess with your adrenal glands, which makes the body go into an emergency response and hold on to dietary fats. If this happens for long enough, the body will start storing fat all the time instead of using it for fuel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ACV is an anti-fungal, so it\u2019s going to help you clean up the excess yeast in your gut that might be causing you to hold on to fat. Tests show that it\u2019s a possible therapeutic treatment for candida overgrowth. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25219289\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>ACV Can Balance Blood Sugar<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are multiple studies that show how effective apple cider vinegar is controlling blood sugar spikes, especially for people who are prediabetic or have type 2 diabetes. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/07\/19\/health\/apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not the vinegar alone, but the acetic acid that\u2019s doing it. It interferes with the enzymes that are responsible for breaking down <a href=\"https:\/\/experiencelife.com\/article\/the-truth-about-refined-grains\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">starches<\/a>, like the ones you find in bread and pasta. If you had a bowl of fruit and ACV, it wouldn\u2019t have any impact on your blood sugar levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Starches cause spikes in blood sugar, which causes you to feel hungry, so you eat more!<\/strong> The acetic acid causes the body to not digest starch, which means it doesn\u2019t move into the bloodstream and contribute to your caloric intake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be careful, though! Before you run out and buy a bunch of ACV and stop at the donut store on your way home, remember this; if you overload on starchy foods, the apple cider vinegar can only take care of so much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The recommended maximum amount you can take safely is 2 tablespoons a day<\/strong>, and it can only break down a certain amount of starches before it stops working. Moderation is your best bet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Use ACV for Weight-Loss<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2qSGxpo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Apple cider vinegar<\/a>, along with a healthy diet and exercise, can help with weight loss, but it\u2019s not the best tasting supplement in the world. It has a sour, acidic flavor that many people don\u2019t like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also burns when you drink it, almost like a shot of tequila!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest and most delicious way to get its health benefits is to use it as a <a href=\"https:\/\/detoxinista.com\/raw-apple-cider-vinaigrette\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">salad dressing<\/a>. <strong>Mix it with some olive oil and herbs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/apple-cider-vinegar-salad-dressing.jpg\" alt=\"apple cider vinegar salad dressing\" class=\"wp-image-28601\" title=\"apple cider vinegar salad dressing\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/apple-cider-vinegar-salad-dressing.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/apple-cider-vinegar-salad-dressing-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/apple-cider-vinegar-salad-dressing-365x244.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/apple-cider-vinegar-salad-dressing-355x237.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It can also add some nice flavor as a <a href=\"https:\/\/busycreatingmemories.com\/best-grilled-chicken-recipe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marinade<\/a> for pork or chicken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer your cider straight, <strong>mix 1 to 2 tablespoons with 8 ounces of water and drink it<\/strong>. It\u2019s important to mix it with water because it can erode your tooth enamel and irritate the soft tissues of your mouth and throat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good way to get around that is to eat it instead of drink it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to get raw apple cider with the \u201cmother,\u201d or you won\u2019t get its awesome benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Here Are Some Things to Consider Before Using Apple Cider Vinegar<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ACV is one of those foods that\u2019s highly acidic outside the stomach. <strong>Many people in studies who reported that it was a good hunger suppressant did so because it gave them an upset tummy<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we said before, it\u2019s also not good for the enamel on your teeth, the primary reason being that it\u2019s so acidic. Mixing it with an alkaline oil helps balance out the pH, so eating it the easiest way to combat its ill-effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple cider vinegar is known to help with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/146619.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acid reflux<\/a>, but if you use too much or don\u2019t drink enough water with it, it can have the opposite effect and actually cause it! It can burn the mouth, throat, and esophagus if you overindulge or aren\u2019t using it properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to know that <strong>apple cider vinegar can lower <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/top-10-potassium-rich-foods\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>potassium<\/strong><\/a><strong> levels in your bloodstream<\/strong>. There has only been one reported case of this, but the person using it was drinking 8 ounces a day, in a classic example of too much of a good thing. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/apple-cider-vinegar-side-effects#section2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re taking certain meds, like diabetes medication or blood thinners, make sure to check with your doctor first. ACV influences insulin levels. If you\u2019re pregnant, you should also ask your doctor about using it because it\u2019s not pasteurized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2qSGxpo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Bragg&#8217;s Apple Cider Vinegar<\/a> is one of the best brands on the market, so make sure to look out for that brand at your local grocery store or on <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2qSGxpo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Amazon<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Looking for a REAL Plan to Lose Weight Fast?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s fast weight loss that you&#8217;re after, you need a serious plan.
