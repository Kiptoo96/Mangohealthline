There are many weight loss tips that don\u2019t add up to much, though, and will end up being a waste of time trying them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 17 weight loss tips for women backed by new scientific studies and proven to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S.

After 12 weeks, the women who drank the water lost an average of 4 pounds more. Even though they were all on the same diet.

Cook with coconut oil.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A common mistake that dieters can make is cutting healthy fats out of their diet.<\/strong> Coconut oil has triglycerides in it, which are fats that help with metabolism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/coconut-oil-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coconut oil use in weight loss<\/a> is backed by science with multiple studies.
