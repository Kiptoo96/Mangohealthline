Although most people associate cardio with heart health, bodyweight exercises have health benefits too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Another benefit of bodyweight exercises is that they can be done in your own home<\/em>. That can save you time and money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re not motivated to do pushups by yourself on your carpet,<strong> work out along to these videos<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The workouts are much more fun than your basic calisthenics, and you can vary your workout as much as you\u2019d like.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. No Equipment Barre Workout<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VI5PeLs8Cxs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>Many barre workouts require you to hold onto something for stability. This hour-long sculpting session doesn\u2019t require any equipment. Balancing will help you engage more muscles as you exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a total body workout. Even though it doesn\u2019t involve jumping or running, it will increase your heart rate too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a large focus on your lower body. However, you\u2019ll also work your arms, back, chest and core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Kelli&#8217;s Favorite Bodyweight Workout &#8211; Total Body Toning &amp; Functional Strength Training Exercises<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/U7K6yFOjsJI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>During this toning and strength workout, you\u2019ll do three rounds of 8 exercises. You\u2019ll perform 10 repetitions of each exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The instructor talks you through every movement. There\u2019s no music, which might make this routine a little boring. However, we like that it gives us the chance to play our own music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At just over 30 minutes, this routine is great to add in after a cardio session. It\u2019s also a wonderful workout to do on its own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Fat-Burning HIIT Pilates Workout<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/G9TSbIrp8qQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>This combo of Pilates, HIIT and cardio should get your heart pumping. If you\u2019ve shied away from Pilates in the past because you\u2019re not sure that you\u2019ll get a good workout, this is a great way to get into it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though traditional Pilates may still be a butt-kicking workout, this routine takes things up a notch. You\u2019ll do 6 groups of two exercises. The first exercise is a Pilates move. The second is a cardio interval.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a little repetitive. Some days, the repetition can make things go faster. You know what\u2019s coming up. Other days, it can feel tedious. It\u2019s a good thing you have all of these other workouts from which to choose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. 5-Min Brutal Full Body Workout No Equipment &#8211; Focus on Legs and Belly Fat Loss<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WZhJoRxWcLE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>The instructor claims that this workout will torch up to 300 calories in 35 minutes. The key is timing your exercises instead of counting repetitions. As you become more advanced, you can push even harder and go through the repetitions more quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The routine is designed for weight loss. Although it concentrates on the legs and abs, it targets the entire body. It will help <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/exercises-to-slim-your-waist-and-tone-your-core\/\">slim and strengthen your core<\/a>, lift and tone your glutes and reduce fat on your arms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This video does incorporate a quick warm-up. However, there is no cool-down. You might want to do some stretches after you\u2019re done to keep everything loose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. The Best 15-Minute Beginner Workout \u2014 No Equipment Needed<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/GS_z6FG_jqE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>This workout is great for beginners and even has beginner modifications! It will work out every part of your body and leave you full of sweat in no time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part is&#8230; It&#8217;s only 15 minutes long! This will help you from making excuses and skipping that workout&#8230; AGAIN!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. 30 Minute Bodyweight Blast Workout<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/5Om6M8elJtg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>BodyFit by Amy hosts a 30-minute bodyweight workout. You can use dumbbells if you choose, but the workout is designed to be done with bodyweight alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s ideal for any fitness level. If you\u2019re a beginner, you can follow along easily. The instructor models the moves during each break.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re advanced, you may be familiar with many of the exercises already. Concentrate on your form, and keep going until it\u2019s time to rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. No-Run Cardio Workout to Burn Calories<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hQU08BlmYG4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this workout incorporates some quick moves, it also sculpts your muscles. Squat jumps, arm jabs, lunges and bunny hops tone your legs, abs, arms, chest, shoulders, and back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you keep your abs engaged, you\u2019ll work your core and improve your posture. You might be out of breath when you do this workout. Your muscles may feel it the next day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video offers a great cool-down that allows you to stretch and open your muscles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we part, if you are looking for a program with an <strong>aggressive diet to help you shed weight FAST (that doesn&#8217;t actually require working out!),<\/strong> make sure to check out our <a href=\"http:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>21-Day Fat Loss Challenge.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"266\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-1024x266.png\" alt=\"Avocadu 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge\" class=\"wp-image-25089\" title=\"Avocadu 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-1024x266.png 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-300x78.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-768x200.png 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-365x95.png 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-355x92.png 355w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min.png 1153w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a <strong>high protein, low carb diet plan that helps our clients lose <em>10-21 pounds in just 21 days.<\/em><\/strong> We have over 2,000 members in our private community group for the program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>Click here to get started with your 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge today!<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related Articles<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/the-best-forearm-workouts-for-women-and-men\/\">The Best Forearm Workouts for Women and Men<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/fat-burning-barre-workouts-for-beginners\/\">10 Fat-Burning Barre Workouts for Beginners<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/10-killer-workouts-burn-fat-running\/\">10 Killer Workouts That Burn More Fat Than Running<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/30-minute-full-body-fat-burning-workouts\/\">30-Minute Full-Body Fat-Burning Workouts<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/best-at-home-exercise-equipment-to-lose-weight\/\">The Best at Home Exercise Equipment to Lose Weight<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It can be hard to get motivated to exercise.
