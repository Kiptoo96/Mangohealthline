Sounds good, right? Well, not when it leads to midnight cookie binges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When cortisol levels surge, your body thinks it needs extra fuel because it&#8217;s preparing for, you guessed it, fight or flight. So, it makes you hungry\u2014like, &#8220;I could eat a whole pizza&#8221; hungry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, this might have been useful when we were hunters and gatherers facing real, immediate dangers, but nowadays, our stressors are more like looming deadlines or awkward family dinners.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, our bodies haven&#8217;t caught up to this change in the stress landscape. You see, cortisol has a VIP pass to your brain, particularly to the regions that control mood, motivation, and fear.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It flips switches and turns dials, messing with your hunger hormones, ghrelin and leptin. When cortisol&#8217;s in the mix, ghrelin (the hunger hormone) goes up, and leptin (the fullness hormone) takes a backseat. The result? You feel famished, even if you just ate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the kind of foods you crave when you&#8217;re stressed. We&#8217;re not talking carrot sticks and hummus here. You&#8217;ll likely gravitate towards sugary, fatty, salty treats\u2014aka comfort foods.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These foods trigger the release of certain brain chemicals that make you feel good, temporarily. The bad news is that these are also the types of food most associated with weight gain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High cortisol levels also tell your body to store fat, especially in the abdominal area. So, not only are you eating more, but your body is also storing more fat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mental well-being takes a hit, and your body follows suit. Maintaining or <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/ultimate-weight-loss-guide\/\">losing weight<\/a> during the holidays? That becomes a steep uphill battle when stress comes into play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Planning is Your Best Friend<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-planning-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Managing Holiday Stress to Avoid Holiday Weight Gain planning\" class=\"wp-image-37378\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-planning-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-planning-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-planning-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-planning-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-planning.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people reserve planning for business tasks or out-of-town adventures, but when it comes to the holiday season, planning becomes an essential tool for managing stress and avoiding weight gain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a list of every task you have to tackle during the holiday season. This list should include everything\u2014buying gifts, decorating your home, making food, you name it. The act of writing it down clears your mind and provides a step-by-step guide to follow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a list in hand, you gain a sense of control. A laundry list of tasks can quickly make anyone feel overwhelmed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High stress levels can be a gateway to weight gain. But a list allows you to prioritize and attack tasks one at a time. This simplifies things and lessens the urge to munch on comfort foods when stress hits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Divide each primary task into smaller, more specific tasks. If you&#8217;re in charge of the holiday dinner, don&#8217;t just write &#8220;Make dinner.&#8221; Specify the smaller tasks like &#8220;Buy vegetables,&#8221; &#8220;Marinate meat,&#8221; or &#8220;Arrange seating.&#8221; Handling smaller tasks makes the whole project seem a lot easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s the best part: you can include slots for exercise and meal preparation. Knowing you have a gym session at 2 PM makes you less likely to skip it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve set aside Sunday afternoon for cooking healthy meals, you won&#8217;t be as tempted by unhealthy options later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The simple act of planning can yield multiple benefits, from lowering stress to helping you stick to your weight goals. A little time spent organizing can have big payoffs for both your mental state and your waistline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mindfulness Matters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-mindfulness-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Managing Holiday Stress to Avoid Holiday Weight Gain mindfulness\" class=\"wp-image-37377\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-mindfulness-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-mindfulness-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-mindfulness-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-mindfulness-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-mindfulness.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mindfulness isn&#8217;t just a trendy buzzword you see splashed across wellness blogs or lifestyle magazines; it&#8217;s a practical, effective way to manage stress.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of it is that you don&#8217;t need to set aside large chunks of time or make it complicated. Just a few minutes every day can make a real impact on how you handle stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by setting aside a few minutes each day, maybe in the morning or before bed, to sit quietly and focus on your breathing. It&#8217;s as straightforward as that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to concentrate on the here and now, not the pile of unwrapped gifts in the corner or the long grocery list waiting for you. By directing your attention to your breath, you interrupt the constant chatter in your mind, making room for a more peaceful state of being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re giving your mind a short but impactful break when you practice mindfulness. Think of it as hitting the refresh button on your mental browser.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A clear, refreshed mind is less susceptible to stress. And as we&#8217;ve already talked about, lower stress levels mean less cortisol circulating through your system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By keeping cortisol levels in check through mindfulness, you&#8217;re less likely to feel the pull of the cookie jar or the temptation of a quick, greasy meal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But mindfulness can also have a more direct effect on your eating habits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many times have you found yourself mindlessly munching on a bag of chips while watching TV? Being <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/guide-to-mindful-eating\/\">mindful<\/a> when you eat encourages you to pay attention to what and when you eat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You become more aware of portion sizes, and you savor each bite, which can lead to eating less and enjoying your food more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those few minutes of daily mindfulness serve a dual purpose. They not only help keep stress at bay but also act as a simple yet effective tactic to maintain your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-holiday-weight\/\">weight during the hectic holiday<\/a> season.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the best part? Mindfulness is free and requires no special equipment or training. Just you, a few quiet minutes, and your breath.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Work Out, Don&#8217;t Stress Out<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-workout-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Managing Holiday Stress to Avoid Holiday Weight Gain workout\" class=\"wp-image-37381\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-workout-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-workout-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-workout-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-workout-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-workout.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The holidays can be a time of joy, but let&#8217;s face it, they can also become overwhelming pretty fast.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amidst the chaos, exercise often gets bumped down the priority list. But here&#8217;s the thing: working out should be non-negotiable, especially during the hectic holiday season. It&#8217;s not just about toning up or burning calories; it&#8217;s about looking after your mental well-being, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercise triggers the release of endorphins in your brain. Think of endorphins as your internal cheerleaders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When these chemicals are set loose, you instantly feel better, lighter, happier. Who couldn&#8217;t use a mood boost when facing an avalanche of holiday tasks, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s more to the endorphin story. This boost in mood makes it easier for you to make better food choices. You know that moment of weakness when you&#8217;re staring at a chocolate bar, trying to summon the willpower to walk away?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A surge of endorphins can give you that extra push to opt for a healthier alternative. With a clearer, more balanced emotional state, you&#8217;re more likely to reach for a nutritious snack like a salad or a fruit rather than calorie-laden options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistent physical activity also has the power to regulate your emotional swings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The holidays can be a rollercoaster of emotions\u2014joy, stress, excitement, anxiety. When you exercise regularly, you equip yourself with a tool to level out those peaks and valleys. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A consistent workout routine can help you develop emotional resilience, making you less susceptible to stress-induced eating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another bonus? Exercise is an excellent way to counterbalance the extra calories that come with holiday feasts and treats.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 30-minute jog or an hour of yoga can go a long way in maintaining your weight during a season filled with culinary temptations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re not just burning calories; you&#8217;re also strengthening your body&#8217;s ability to manage stress in a healthier way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than viewing exercise as an optional holiday activity, treat it as a critical component of your stress management and weight control strategy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s a quick jog around the block or a 20-minute <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/the-ultimate-guide-to-at-home-workouts-for-women\/\">home workout<\/a>, make sure to carve out some time for physical activity. Your future less-stressed, same-weight self will thank you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Eating Your Way to Calm<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-eating-your-way-to-calm-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Managing Holiday Stress to Avoid Holiday Weight Gain eating your way to calm\" class=\"wp-image-37373\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-eating-your-way-to-calm-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-eating-your-way-to-calm-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-eating-your-way-to-calm-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-eating-your-way-to-calm-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-eating-your-way-to-calm.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Food is so much more than just fuel for your body; it&#8217;s also a powerful tool that can either amp up your stress or dial it down.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The food-stress connection goes both ways: just as stress can make you crave unhealthy foods, eating certain foods can spike your stress levels. It&#8217;s a loop, but you have the power to break it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-sugar foods may give you a temporary boost, but let&#8217;s be real, they&#8217;re also culprits that can make your stress levels go through the roof.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side, foods rich in nutrients have the opposite effect: they help manage your stress and keep your weight in check. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the kind of eating cycle you want to establish, especially during the busy holiday season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low glycemic fruits and veggies are your friends when stress starts to creep in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? These plant-based goodies are chock-full of essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber that help stabilize your blood sugar levels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stable blood sugar means a more balanced mood, making you less likely to make poor food choices when stress hits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lean proteins like chicken, fish, and legumes can also be incredibly helpful.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proteins contain amino acids, which are the building blocks for neurotransmitters in your brain. These neurotransmitters help regulate your mood and stress response.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A protein-rich meal can literally help your brain process stress more efficiently, making it easier to stay calm and focused amidst holiday chaos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your food choices can either help or hinder your stress and weight management. Opting for low glycemic fruits, veggies, and lean proteins not only keeps your body healthy but also puts you in a better state of mind to handle whatever the holiday season throws at you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Have a Go-To Relaxation Technique<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-relaxation.jpg\" alt=\"Managing Holiday Stress to Avoid Holiday Weight Gain relaxation\" class=\"wp-image-37380\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stress often occurs unexpectedly. One moment you feel calm, and suddenly you find yourself overwhelmed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This abrupt shift can prompt you to make unhealthy eating decisions. Having a go-to relaxation technique can be a valuable strategy in those instances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your technique doesn&#8217;t have to be elaborate or time-consuming. In fact, the simpler, the better\u2014because you&#8217;re more likely to actually do it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s a specific breathing exercise you learned in a yoga class. The 4-7-8 technique is an easy one: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold it for 7 seconds, and then exhale for 8 seconds. Do it three times, and you&#8217;ve got a one-minute stress-busting routine right there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stepping outside for some fresh air and a quick stroll can be another game-changer. Just the act of changing your environment can interrupt the stress feedback loop in your brain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking increases blood flow and can help clear your mind. Five to ten minutes is often enough to lower your stress levels and provide a mental reset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to a calming piece of music or an uplifting podcast for a few minutes can also work wonders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sound has a direct impact on your mood and stress levels. Find what resonates with you and make it easily accessible on your phone for stress emergencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is this crucial for weight management? When stress hits, your brain is looking for immediate comfort, which is why you might find yourself reaching for that bowl of ice cream or bag of chips.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a quick, easy relaxation technique provides an alternative way to cope with stress that doesn&#8217;t involve high-calorie comfort food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spend some time finding a relaxation technique that works for you and make it your go-to move for when stress strikes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practicing it regularly will make it second nature, giving you a reliable tool to manage both stress and weight during the unpredictable holiday season.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Set Realistic Expectations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-realistic-goals-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Managing Holiday Stress to Avoid Holiday Weight Gain realistic goals\" class=\"wp-image-37379\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-realistic-goals-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-realistic-goals-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-realistic-goals-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-realistic-goals-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-realistic-goals.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The holidays come with a heap of tasks, events, and obligations. The pressure to be everywhere and do everything is real, but let&#8217;s hit the pause button for a moment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overcommitting yourself is a one-way ticket to Stressville, and guess what? Stressville is also where all your weight management efforts can come undone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s the fix? Be brutally honest with yourself about what you can and can&#8217;t handle. There&#8217;s a finite amount of time and energy at your disposal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overloading your to-do list not only leaves you frazzled but also ups the temptation to stress-eat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you RSVP &#8216;yes&#8217; to every holiday invitation or agree to bake another dozen cookies for your child&#8217;s school event, assess your current commitments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a hard look at your schedule. Where can you realistically fit in these additional activities without tipping your stress scale?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, the most empowering word you can say is a simple &#8220;no.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being selective about your commitments has ripple effects on your well-being. When you&#8217;re less stressed, you&#8217;re better equipped to make mindful food choices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, high-stress levels crank up your body&#8217;s cortisol, which nudges you to seek out comfort foods that are typically high in sugar and fat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By reducing your commitments, you reduce opportunities for stress-induced eating, which goes a long way in helping you maintain your weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another perk of setting realistic expectations is the time it frees up for self-care activities. With a less crammed schedule, you can find time for that 20-minute workout or to prepare a nutritious meal, both of which are cornerstones of weight management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you look ahead to the holiday season, don&#8217;t overlook the power of <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/setting-realistic-weight-loss-goals\/\">setting realistic<\/a> expectations. Give yourself permission to prioritize your well-being over an endless list of obligations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A less stressed you is less likely to veer off the path of <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/16-make-ahead-meals-and-snacks-for-healthy-eating-on-the-go\/\">healthy eating<\/a>, and that&#8217;s something truly worth celebrating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reach Out for Support<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-friends-support-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Managing Holiday Stress to Avoid Holiday Weight Gain friends support\" class=\"wp-image-37375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-friends-support-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-friends-support-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-friends-support-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-friends-support-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Managing-Holiday-Stress-to-Avoid-Holiday-Weight-Gain-friends-support.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in the idea that you should handle everything on your own, but even the strongest people need help sometimes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to stress and its sneaky ability to tip the scale in the wrong direction, two heads are definitely better than one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking openly with friends or family about what&#8217;s stressing you out can be incredibly relieving.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, just vocalizing your concerns provides a fresh perspective on how to manage them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your friends and family can also offer solutions you may not have considered, or even take some tasks off your hands to lighten your load. Less stress on your plate often means fewer sugary or fatty foods going onto it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let&#8217;s not forget about digital support! There are numerous apps available that focus on stress management techniques, nutrition tracking, and exercise routines.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilizing these digital tools can make it easier to stay on track with your goals, and most come with online communities for additional moral support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tips for Shopping and Holiday Errands<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Holiday shopping and errands can feel like running a marathon without any training\u2014exhausting, stressful, and overwhelming.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But guess what?

It saves you from driving, parking, and wrestling your way through crowded stores.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, many online retailers offer exclusive deals, so you could save some money too! If you prefer the in-store experience, aim to go during off-peak hours\u2014think weekday mornings or late evenings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Less crowd means less stress, and less stress means you&#8217;ll be less likely to grab a candy bar at checkout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make a List, Check It Twice<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before heading out, make a thorough list of what you need. A well-thought-out list is like a road map for efficient shopping.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing exactly what you&#8217;re looking for eliminates that aimless wandering through aisles, which can be both time-consuming and anxiety-inducing. Remember, stress and weight gain are pals; cutting down aimless roaming can help you avoid impulse buys of unhealthy snacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cluster Your Errands<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When planning your errands, try to cluster them geographically. This way, you can hit multiple spots in a single trip, minimizing travel time and reducing the chances of getting frazzled.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Less time running errands means more time to focus on activities that keep your stress low and your eating <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/build-healthy-habits-for-weight-loss\/\">habits healthy<\/a>, like exercise or meal prep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bring a Snack<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It might sound trivial, but packing a healthy snack can be a lifesaver. A small bag of almonds or a piece of fruit can help stave off hunger and prevent a stress-induced junk food binge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, when you&#8217;re not hungry, you make better choices both in terms of shopping and eating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take Short Breaks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re out and about for extended periods, don&#8217;t hesitate to take short breaks. Sit down for a few minutes, have a sip of water, and take some deep breaths. It can reset your stress levels and help you tackle the rest of your to-do list with a clear mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By optimizing your approach to holiday shopping and errands, you can save time, reduce stress, and make it easier to stick to your weight management goals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little planning and a lot of discipline go a long way in making the holiday season a joyful and healthy experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level Up Your Holiday Game with the 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The holiday season might come with its share of stressors, but it also offers a golden opportunity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a chance to actively participate in your own well-being, and what better way to do that than with a targeted plan like our <a href=\"https:\/\/programs.avocadu.com\/p\/21-day-fat-loss-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a>?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"240\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-1024x240.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36179\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-1024x240.png 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-300x70.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-768x180.png 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-1536x359.png 1536w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-150x35.png 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min.png 1932w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only can this program be your roadmap to better weight management, but it&#8217;s also a way to kickstart a healthier you for the new year ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/programs.avocadu.com\/p\/21-day-fat-loss-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a> is conveniently structured to fit between major holidays.
