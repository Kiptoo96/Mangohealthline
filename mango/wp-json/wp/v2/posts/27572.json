Cravings can be the downfall of a successful diet, but so can added-and often hidden-sugar in the foods you eat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sugar has <strong>empty calories, messes with your metabolism, gives you <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-belly-fat-fast\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">belly fat<\/span><\/a>, and makes your insulin wonky, which can lead to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/insulin-resistance-and-weight-loss\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insulin resistance<\/a><\/span> and ultimately obesity.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a host of other health issues that it contributes to, including <em>cancer and dementia.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve searched and found this article on reducing your sugar intake, so you&#8217;ve already made the first step in this process, which is often the hardest! We&#8217;ve recognized the problem&#8230; Now, let&#8217;s fix it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guys, this doesn&#8217;t mean you have to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/quit-your-sugar-addiction\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">quit sugar altogether<\/span><\/a>, but you should at least find ways to cut down on it. That way you can enjoy your sweets and guilty pleasures from time to time without going crazy overboard on your daily sugar intake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Here are eight easy ways to cut down on sugar for good&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Read food labels.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you buy a lot of <strong>packaged and processed foods<\/strong>, it\u2019s important to <strong>read labels of <em>every<\/em> packaged item you buy.<\/strong> Cracking a sugar addiction is hard enough when cutting out the stuff that you already know is loaded with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn to recognize <a href=\"https:\/\/healthyeating.sfgate.com\/different-words-sugar-food-labels-8373.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">sugar\u2019s sneaky aliases<\/span><\/a>, like high fructose corn syrup, dried cane syrup, molasses, sucrose, dextrose, agave, honey, and maple syrup, to name a few.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manufacturers love to hide sugar in foods that you wouldn\u2019t think have it. Bread, pasta, yogurt, kefir, salad dressing, almond milk, and even ketchup can be loaded with sugar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the carbohydrates look a little high, it probably has more sugar than you realize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take time to look at the ingredients as well as the sugar content and make an effort to choose foods and brands that have zero added sugar.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Stop drinking it.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/sugar-drink-soda.jpg\" alt=\"removing soda from your diet is one of the easy easy to cut down on sugar\" class=\"wp-image-8103\" title=\"removing soda from your diet is one of the easy easy to cut down on sugar\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/sugar-drink-soda.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/sugar-drink-soda-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/sugar-drink-soda-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that few things are more satisfying than a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/13-ways-sugary-soda-is-bad-for-you#section1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sweet drink<\/a><\/span> to give you a little pick-me-up during the day. Maybe a little sugar in your coffee, a bottled iced tea, or an icy, cold soda.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Just one or two isn\u2019t a big deal, right?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are SO many studies out there that say the same thing about drinks with added sugar; they are THE most fattening part of an American diet. <strong>Sugary drinks can increase your risk of obesity by at least 60%.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diet drinks with artificial sweeteners are even worse! Not only do they increase your obesity risk just like sugar, but the <strong>chemicals<\/strong> themselves are really bad for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Love yourself enough to let go of the caramel macchiato or the fountain drink<\/strong> you grab on the way home. &nbsp;Good health is sweeter than soda.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/iced-coffee-protein-shake-recipes-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">make your own iced coffee with protein!<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Eat regularly and often.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There always seems to be a mad dash toward the vending machines or convenience store in the afternoon. The candy aisle is a popular place that time of the day. <em>The 3:00 slump is dangerous to our productivity AND our health!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People often skip lunch because they\u2019re too busy to leave their desk, they forget their lunch, or they\u2019re on a budget. There are a million reasons why, but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fitday.com\/fitness-articles\/nutrition\/healthy-eating\/3-reasons-skipping-meals-is-unhealthy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">skipping meals<\/a> or not having a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/10-yummy-high-protein-low-carb-snacks\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">healthy snack<\/span><\/a> option is the death knell of many a diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not eating regularly doesn\u2019t help you lose weight, and it certainly doesn\u2019t make things easy when you\u2019re trying to cut down on sugar<strong>. Blood sugar levels drop when you\u2019re hungry<\/strong>, which can make you crave a sweet snack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another pro tip: Make a rule to never eat outside of mealtimes but allow yourself coffee and tea in between to help <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/7-natural-appetite-suppressants-for-healthy-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">suppress your appetite<\/span><\/a> and keep you from boredom eating!

Add spices to satisfy your taste buds. <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve got a sweet tooth, sometimes it\u2019s hard to eat anything without a little bit sugar. Fortunately, there are lots of <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/13-best-herbs-spices-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">yummy spices<\/span><\/a> that have zero calories and sugar <\/strong>available to make life a little sweeter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can\u2019t do anything without a latte in the morning, order an unsweetened one, then add <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2ksTXrv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">cocoa<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2kq5Bnd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">vanilla powder<\/a> that doesn\u2019t have sugar in it. You can sprinkle some cinnamon, coriander, or nutmeg on oatmeal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/health-benefits-cinnamon\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cinnamon<\/a> will make things taste sweet, but it has the added benefit of helping you control your appetite by regulating blood sugar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Remind yourself why you want to cut down on sugar.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You know sugar isn\u2019t good for you, but that little voice inside your head that tells you \u201c<em>donuts are love<\/em>\u201d keeps sabotaging your efforts to make better choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need to go all scared-straight on yourself. You know that <strong>sugar has been linked to everything from obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and even Alzheimer\u2019s<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply remind yourself of what your goals are. Do you want to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/fastest-way-to-lose-weight-in-3-weeks\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lose weight<\/a>,<\/span> decrease your risks of cancer, or feel better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stick a note on your refrigerator door, or kitchen cabinets, or a daily reminder on your phone about all the wonderful health goals you have. They\u2019ll quiet your cookie monster alter-ego and help you stay on track!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Keep sugary treats and snacks out of your home.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/healthy-fridge-to-reduce-sugar-intake-min.jpg\" alt=\"keep a healthy fridge to reduce sugar intake\" class=\"wp-image-27710\" title=\"keep a healthy fridge to reduce sugar intake\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/healthy-fridge-to-reduce-sugar-intake-min.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/healthy-fridge-to-reduce-sugar-intake-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/healthy-fridge-to-reduce-sugar-intake-min-365x243.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/healthy-fridge-to-reduce-sugar-intake-min-355x236.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>For you single folks out there, this might seem like a no-brainer. However, when you have kids, a hungry husband, or an ultra-skinny roommate, it\u2019s a lot harder to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kids love sugar for many reasons. Their taste buds aren\u2019t fully developed yet, so sweet and salty flavors are the most enticing things. Plus, there are massive marketing campaigns directed towards the little ones that push sweet things like cereal and candy bars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/sugar-destroys-childs-long-term-health\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">sugar is very dangerous for children<\/span><\/strong><\/a> too, especially because their bodies and minds are still developing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do the whole family a favor and keep it out of the house. Take special trips with your kids when you go out for sweets and treat it like a reward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Take high-quality supplements.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Did you know that nutrient deficiencies can cause food cravings<\/strong>? If you\u2019re dieting, you might be low on certain vitamins and minerals, which can make you jones for sweets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2zS0UVX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Magnesium<\/span><\/a> helps regulate glucose, insulin, and dopamine. If you don\u2019t have enough in your system, it can make you go all kinds of crazy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Low dopamine levels have a lot to do with addictive behaviors.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that you\u2019re addicted to sugar. <em>You can quit any time, right?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re having a hard-core craving and riding the sugar pony, try taking some <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2kpC253\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">L Glutamine<\/span><\/a>. It can relieve cravings because the food uses it for fuel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Need a plan?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are having trouble losing weight or kicking your sugar addiction, our <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a><\/span><\/strong> would be a really great fit for you.
