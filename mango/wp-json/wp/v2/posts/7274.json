Set specific goals, and let them be your motivation.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the reason that you are trying to get more flexible? &nbsp;Is it because you want to do the splits? Is it because you saw this certain pose and just HAVE to be able to do it? &nbsp;Is it because you want to relieve your lower back pain?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Find your reason, and set that as your goal. &nbsp;Let it motivate you to get on your mat every day and stretch it out.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the biggest goal I have had since starting yoga is to be able to do the splits. &nbsp;I am fairly tall, and VERY inflexible, especially in the hamstrings. &nbsp;I have to work at it EVERY DAY, but I do, because I want to get there and know that I can with practice!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.

Practice, Practice, Practice.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the most common questions we get regarding stretching and flexibility are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>How often should I stretch? <\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em><strong>How long should I stretch?<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">&nbsp;I wish there was a magic number to tell you here. &nbsp;I know that I was looking for it when I started my flexibility journey. &nbsp;The truth is, <strong>it depends.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">It depends on just how fast you want to achieve your goals. &nbsp;It depends on whether you tend to get sore from stretching. &nbsp;It depends on how much time you want to invest. &nbsp;Let&#8217;s talk about it&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/woman-with-yoga-mat.jpg\" alt=\"woman with yoga mat\" class=\"wp-image-7538\" title=\"woman with yoga mat\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/woman-with-yoga-mat.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/woman-with-yoga-mat-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/woman-with-yoga-mat-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>How often should I stretch?<\/strong> &nbsp;If you are looking for serious and tangible results, you should stretch at a fair level of intensity <strong>AT LEAST <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">3x per week<\/span>.<\/strong> &nbsp;If you want FAST results, you should stretch every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Some days can be longer and more intense stretching than others, but you should be getting those muscles <strong>warmed up in some way at least once per day.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>How long should I stretch?<\/strong> &nbsp;Again this is up to you, but the recommended time to stretch EACH muscle is <strong>AT LEAST <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">30 seconds<\/span><\/strong> if you want to see real results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">It&#8217;s even better if you can stretch a certain muscle group for at least 1 minute at a time. &nbsp;For example, my goal is the splits, so I spend at least 1 minute in every type of stretch or pose that I do for my hamstrings and my hips (because flexibility in both is necessary&nbsp;for the splits).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">When you are stretching, <strong>reach as far as you comfortably can and hold the pose.<\/strong> &nbsp;When your body adjusts, and you feel the tension ease up a bit, try to stretch a little further. &nbsp;Continue this process through the 30 seconds &#8211; 1 minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">You will likely experience <strong>mild soreness<\/strong> some days, but this is normal and does not mean that you have to stop stretching. &nbsp;Slowly ease into the stretch the next day, and the soreness will dissipate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Be aware though that <strong>pain is not normal<\/strong> and means that you may have pulled a muscle. &nbsp;Make sure to start slowly, and listen to your body. &nbsp;Ease up when you feel&nbsp;any pain. &nbsp;An injury will set you back weeks or even months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">It seems a little time consuming, right? Well, this leads to our next point&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.
