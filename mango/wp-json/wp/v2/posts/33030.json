has always been chores. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while part of it is my personality (oops), a big part of it is because I\u2019m chronically ill&#8211;I\u2019m already exhausted from work,&nbsp; and my other tasks and so house cleaning isn\u2019t a top priority of mine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>However, your exercise and your chores can be two birds with one stone.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding activity to your daily routine doesn\u2019t have to look like a traditional workout.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fitness can be:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>doing your laundry&nbsp;<\/li><li>taking an extra trip to get the groceries out of the car<\/li><li>parking further away from your

are ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/burn-500-calories-without-weights\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">exercise without the weights.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working out is what you make it to

people would watch me if I modified an exercise at the gym. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if I was alone, I was just so hard on myself for not being where I wanted to be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over time, I learned that no one is watching you at the gym, and the only way you can get to where you want to go is by taking that first step.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are not jumping to step 10, where you will injure yourself or flare your condition and end up back to step -5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be okay with having to modify and listen to your body. You know how you feel, and you have to be careful within reason, of course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, try new things. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s okay if you mess up, fail, or can\u2019t do all the exercises or moves. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try a water aerobics class or tai chi, or take the dog for a walk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercise doesn\u2019t have to be miserable, and you shouldn\u2019t have to be in pain or avoid it altogether to participate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to feel embarrassed to modify exercises or force yourself to work out when it would be easier to skip it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But letting your disease control your life is also hard, and you get to choose your hard.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ready to Get Started?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re ready to get your body moving and start improving your health, yoga is a great place to start. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Yoga Fat Loss Bible<\/a> has everything you need to get started, and it\u2019s a&nbsp;great solution for those looking to <strong>lose weight, get more flexible, and relieve aches and pains<\/strong> with a calm yoga practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It provides <strong>detailed instructions and beginner modifications<\/strong> for your practice + a <strong>6-Week Workout Plan<\/strong> any beginner can start with!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>Click here to read more about the Yoga Fat Loss Bible!<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always remember that the most difficult part of doing any exercise or yoga program is SHOWING UP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to show up today and give your best to your new workout routine.
