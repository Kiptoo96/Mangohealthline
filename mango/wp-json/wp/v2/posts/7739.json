Cinnamon <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially helpful for type II diabetics, cinnamon is a weight loss spice that has <strong>potent effects on blood sugar levels.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping blood sugar levels down is the key&nbsp;to having clean and steady energy throughout the day. Cinnamon helps <strong>minimize high spikes of insulin<\/strong> caused by eating too many carbohydrates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some great ways to get more cinnamon into your diet&nbsp;is with a whey protein shake, coffee, a bowl of oats, yogurt, or on a lean chicken breast!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.

Ginseng<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ginseng is an herbal root found in Asia and some parts of North America boasting a few powerful benefits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Helps prevent heart disease<\/li><li>Lowers blood sugar levels<\/li><li>Boosts mood<\/li><li>Helps with fatigue<\/li><li>Stimulates weight loss<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common way to get the root in is an <strong>herbal tea<\/strong>. &nbsp;Be careful if you are stimulant sensitive, and start with a &#8220;weaker&#8221;&nbsp;tea if&nbsp;in the beginning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Peppermint<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Peppermint has a curiously potent weight loss effect when it comes to appetite. &nbsp;One study, in particular, showed that those asked to sniff peppermint when feeling hungry ate 1800 fewer calories over the course of one&nbsp;week than those who didn\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t talk much about essential oils, but they would be a good source for getting in a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00OEIBJRW\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fitincol-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00OEIBJRW&amp;linkId=6a7338e82fad4af8168a1d9e3bc1288d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">highly concentrated dose of peppermint<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the oils or make some peppermint tea, and make sure to inhale a few times before drinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Dandelions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every part of a dandelion herb is edible and nutritious. &nbsp;They are full of dietary fiber, beta-carotene, vitamin K1, and many other vitamins and minerals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dandelion tea has also been shown to help<strong> normalize blood sugar, lower cholesterol, and help you&nbsp;feel full<\/strong> after consuming a meal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Turmeric<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/turmeric-spice.jpg\" alt=\"turmeric spice\" class=\"wp-image-7759\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/turmeric-spice.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/turmeric-spice-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/turmeric-spice-365x242.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This yellow-orange spice has several weight loss properties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its specialty is in <strong>reducing the inflammation of fat tissue<\/strong> by reducing the blood vessels needed to form it. It\u2019s also pretty delicious, and something we enjoy adding to our regular meals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add it on top of chicken, eggs, potatoes, or in a delicious tea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Garlic<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding fresh garlic to food not only enhances the taste, but it also has been shown to help the body better <strong>metabolize carbohydrates and fats<\/strong>. &nbsp;Some studies have even shown garlic to prevent the body from creating more fat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add it to food fresh (minced) or in powder form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Cloves<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloves are another spice a healthy kitchen needs because of its ability to speed up metabolism and help the body burn more calories. &nbsp;They are also <strong>anti-inflammatory<\/strong> and very nutrient-dense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They pair very well with&nbsp;turkey and&nbsp;sweet potatoes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Mustard<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/mustard-seeds-for-weight-loss.jpg\" alt=\"mustard seeds for weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-7767\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/mustard-seeds-for-weight-loss.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/mustard-seeds-for-weight-loss-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/mustard-seeds-for-weight-loss-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mustard seeds have a positive thermogenic effect on the body, causing it to <strong>burn more calories naturally<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skip the common yellow mustard sauce often associated with ketchup (it\u2019s filled with sodium), and try seasoning foods with powdered dry mustard seed instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It adds an interesting flavor with a small kick!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>10. Cardamom<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another&nbsp;interesting spice that helps <strong>boost metabolism<\/strong> and has been shown to <strong>lower blood glucose levels<\/strong>. &nbsp;Keeping blood glucose levels down keeps insulin low&nbsp;and the body\u2019s ability to burn fat HIGH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardamom comes in either whole form or powdered, but I&nbsp;recommend powdered for ease of&nbsp;use. Try adding it to chicken to start with. &nbsp;Some people even add it to coffee!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>11. Parsley<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/shutterstock_2530128371.jpg\" alt=\"parsley can aid in weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-3981\" title=\"parsley can aid in weight loss\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/shutterstock_2530128371.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/shutterstock_2530128371-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/shutterstock_2530128371-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Parsley has multiple positive effects on weight loss:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Helps control appetite and suppress cravings<\/li><li>Reduces the amount of sugar in the blood<\/li><li>Helps the body better break down and absorb healthy nutrients<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It goes great in salads, green smoothies, and on lean meats like pork and&nbsp;chicken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>12. Cumin<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cumin helps <strong>improve the digestive system<\/strong> and <strong>boost the immune system<\/strong>. &nbsp;It helps the body process nutrients more efficiently, and therefore gives people more energy and makes them&nbsp;feel less hungry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add cumin to vegetable soups, rice, chili, and salsa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>13.
