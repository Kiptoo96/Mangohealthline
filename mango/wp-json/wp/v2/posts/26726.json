You can get all of that and more these yoga workout videos to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yoga helps you lose those extra pounds in several ways.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you have the exercise itself which can offer some challenges for both with strength and agility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, <em>there is the pace<\/em>. While you may think of yoga as a slow practice, you can ramp up the speed to add a cardio element that will burn calories quicker as an aerobic activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga also supports other forms of exercise to improve your performance for <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/fastest-way-to-lose-weight-in-3-weeks\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rapid weight loss<\/a> even when you\u2019re not on the mat. It <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/exercises-to-slim-your-waist-and-tone-your-core\/\">tones your core<\/a> muscles while improving your flexibility so that you can work harder for a greater calorie burn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga poses emphasize the role of the breath in each position. This controlled breathing can help you experience these moves fully while providing <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/benefits-of-yoga\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">additional health benefits.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A study by the Government Medical College in India found that p<em>ranayama or breath control improved cardiovascular functions in just one week of regular practice<\/em>. It\u2019s a nice perk in addition to the weight loss (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23760377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve rounded up 10 yoga workout videos that can help you achieve your weight loss goals. Each one offers a different challenge, but all have a core element to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit of <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/use-yoga-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yoga for weight loss<\/a> is that it helps s<a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-workout-routines-for-toning-muscles\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trengthen your muscles,<\/a> so they actively burn calories even when you\u2019re at rest. Muscle burns more energy than fat tissue, and thus, a better return on your efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Dolphin Plank Pose<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/6nYSNkAjRZM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dolphin plank pose is a modification of the familiar plank pose. These poses offer a better way to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/8-yoga-poses-strong-core\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">work your core<\/a> for maximum calorie burn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can begin in plank pose or by lying belly down on your mat. Slowly raise your body on your forearms and toes as you hold the position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breathe normally during the move. In addition to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/5-minute-power-yoga-workout-toned-arms\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strengthening your arms<\/a> and abs, you may find this pose very relaxing as you work up from 10 seconds to a full minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the move <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6nYSNkAjRZM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.

Then, prepare to get into the pose by placing your hands beside your hips and tilting yourself back onto your hip bones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, bend your knees and slowly straighten them to a 45-degree angle as you extend your arms out in front of you with your palms facing. You can use a <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2tTL5L2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">yoga strap<\/a> around your feet if you have difficulty staying in the position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll admit it.

It\u2019s a memorable pose and one that targets several muscles groups for weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These types of exercises help you do both aerobic and strengthening in one session for optimal training and conditioning. Current physical activity guidelines from the <a href=\"https:\/\/health.gov\/paguidelines\/guidelines\/adults.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion<\/a> call for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise and two sessions of strength training each week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Begin on all fours. Then, lift your knees off of your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/5-best-yoga-mats-beginner-yogis\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>yoga mat<\/strong><\/a> as you bring your hip upward as you place your heels flat on the floor, holding for 30 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the move <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j97SSGsnCAQ&amp;t=1s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.

Hold your arms parallel to the floor with your right arm extending forward and your left arm going back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold this position for at least 10 seconds and work up to 30 seconds.

That will result in a greater calorie burn as your body strives to keep them full of energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This pose is deceptively easy\u2014until you try it. Begin by standing tall and raising your hands above your head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your arm flexibility, you can keep them parallel or bring your palms together. Then, you will bend your knee until your thighs are as close to parallel to the floor as you get and hold for 30 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This move will work your arm and leg muscles.
