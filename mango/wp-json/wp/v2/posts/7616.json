A staggering 80% of women are effected by this condition at some point in their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>What causes it?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To&nbsp;truly understand how to fix something, one&nbsp;has to first understand what causes it. &nbsp;Cellulite is caused by: &nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Lack of blood flow to the effected region<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plain and simple. &nbsp;<em>When circulation decreases, the collagen levels of the skin also decrease, and fat cells become larger.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the fat cells grow, they begin to \u201cpush\u201d their way to the top as the skin becomes thinner and less elastic. &nbsp;Once the skin has become weak enough and the fat cells are large enough, cellulite occurs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lack of blood flow is primarily caused by \u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Poor water intake<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Sedentary lifestyle<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Decreased estrogen levels as women age<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly enough, weight gain has very little to do with cellulite formation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, during the 70s and 80s, cellulite was not even a relevant cultural issue. It was only once people started working more desk jobs and spending less time on their feet did cellulite become a real problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when looking for the solution for cellulite, these are the thing that needs to be attacked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Brief Point About Going to the Gym and Doing Weights\u2026<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While lifting weights can help&nbsp;with cellulite, it\u2019s not really required. &nbsp;Just general movement is helpful. &nbsp;There are those who want to go to the gym&nbsp;to reduce cellulite and that is fine, just keep in mind <strong>it\u2019s not required<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"fb-like\" data-share=\"false\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-action=\"like\" data-layout=\"standard\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/avocadulife\">We also&nbsp;have an article <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/exercises-combat-cellulite\/\">here about exercises for cellulite reduction<\/a> if you are interested!<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Move.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stand up. &nbsp;Get up. &nbsp;Start walking around. Start moving your body. Find a hobby or activity that REQUIRES lots of movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more you get up out of that chair and move, the <strong>better blood flow<\/strong> you will have and the quicker the cellulite will go away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple rule of thumb is to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">not spend more than 1&nbsp;hour sitting without getting up<\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Dry brushing <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">WORKS<\/span>.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/woman-dry-brushing-leg-min-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"woman dry brushing leg\" class=\"wp-image-7631\" title=\"woman dry brushing leg\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to admit that I was&nbsp;skeptical of&nbsp;\u201cdry brushing\u201d at first, but it seems to have a <strong>powerful effect on cellulite reduction<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes sense because dry brushing causes a direct and immediate blood flow increase to the region being brushed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00LIBEBTG\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fitincol-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00LIBEBTG&amp;linkId=b47fed0b9cafea5d0f394035ad8efb71\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">dry brush<\/a><\/span> and slowly rub the affected area in a circular motion. &nbsp;Do this 1 time per day for around 5 minutes. &nbsp;Any more is unnecessary and can be damaging to the skin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Get a coconut oil massage.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Put your husband or boyfriend to work on your body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key here is to let them be a little bit rough with the body. Not that you should be in pain, but the deeper the massage, the better effects it will have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is to <strong>increase circulation<\/strong> in the skin. &nbsp;Using coconut oil will also better moisturize the skin and help with the healing process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 minutes minimum for best effects!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.
