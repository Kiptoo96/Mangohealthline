Some of us were born with a lot of natural balance (I missed that boat as well&#8230;).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For others, it may be a little more difficult. &nbsp;But you CAN do it, and you will appreciate it that much more!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yoga is about the journey.<\/strong> &nbsp;It&#8217;s a mental and a physical one, and it&#8217;s about growing as a person throughout your journey. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not about being a certain size or level of <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/get-flexible-fast-yoga\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">flexibility<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You are successful as long as you continue to grow and change.&nbsp;<\/strong>Having a bigger frame&nbsp;can make it a little harder to balance, hold ourselves up, and reach certain places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These yoga poses are the perfect&nbsp;beginner poses for plus-sized women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.

Tighten the abdominals, and imagine that there is a rope around your belly, pulling it up towards the ceiling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Breathe in deeply and as you exhale, go into Cat pose (below).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.

As you lift up, focus on engaging your core muscles and lifting up with your core rather than your hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Think of your hands as being very light and just resting on the ground for support. &nbsp;<strong>You should not be using <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/5-minute-power-yoga-workout-toned-arms\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">arm strength<\/a> to lift up, but rather the <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/8-yoga-poses-strong-core\/\"  rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">strength from your core.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Hold this position for 15 seconds, and work on holding it for up to 30 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5.
