Even that is discouraged in most offices between advanced phone systems and email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This convenience has come at a significant price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our sedentary behavior puts us at a greater risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple 10-minute session of yoga modified for the office can do wonders for your health and productivity. It can also <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-for-stress-relief\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">relieve your work stress,<\/a> so you don\u2019t take it home with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Are the Benefits of Office Yoga?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that working women experience a lot of stress in the workplace which has led to greater levels of anxiety and depression. One study found that <strong>women who practiced yoga regularly lowered their stress levels and blood pressure <\/strong>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25906618\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yoga offers more health benefits. A study by Bangor University in the UK found that participants who enrolled in an 8-week yoga course not only reduced their stress but also helped <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-back-pain-relief-best-poses\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">relieve back pain<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23012344\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/benefits-of-yoga\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">benefits of yoga<\/a> on the job extend beyond the workplace. Researchers at Duke University found that participants experienced <strong>better sleep quality<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22352291\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve followed a regular exercise program. You may find that doing office yoga can help get you into the workout habit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers from Pace University and the University of Pittsburgh found that <strong>yoga acted as an effective bridge for increasing physical activity in sedentary adults<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25524471\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may find that it can do the same for you. Let\u2019s dive in with a 10-minute mini workout that you can do in the office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Seated Cat-Cow Pose<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Minute 3:<\/strong> The cat-cow pose is a deceptively easy, but powerful yoga posture or asana. For the office version, you can stay seated, placing your hands on your thighs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inhale as you arch your back and squeeze your shoulder blades together. Then, exhale and bring your chin to your chest like a cat stretching with its back in the air.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slowly move back and forth between the two minutes for one minute, letting your breath guide your movement into each position. Your goal is to follow a gentle rhythm that is aligned with your breathing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ltfbzD8dSwU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>See the move <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ltfbzD8dSwU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Seated Spinal Twist<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Minute 4: <\/strong>Next, let\u2019s work your side muscles with the seated twist. Inhale and exhale as you twist your body to the right side grasping on the back of your chair to keep you stable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold for 15 seconds. Then, repeat going to the left side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For another variation of this pose, you can place your arm behind your back to ease into the twist. Place your right arm along the back of your chair as you twist to the right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold for 15 seconds. Then, repeat on the left side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/D0Uj9yb9T6Q\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>See the move <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D0Uj9yb9T6Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

To relieve tension, till your head first down to your chest using your hand to gently increase the stress by easing it forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold the pose for 10 seconds. Then, tilt your head to the right again increasing the stretch by placing your left hand on your head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold the pose for 10 seconds and repeat going to the left side. Again, hold for 10 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, rotate your head to the right and hold for 10 seconds. Repeat with the left side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, extend your head backward to release tension in the front of your body for 10 seconds. This series of stretches targets different muscles in your neck with simple changes in direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EWAsAseT39A\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>See the moves <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EWAsAseT39A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.

You\u2019ll begin your standing session with a traditional asana called mountain pose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stand tall with your arms at your sides, palms facing forward.

Modified Downward Dog Pose<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Minute 7:<\/strong> This pose is one of the quintessential yoga poses that target several areas in your body. It stretches your shoulders, hamstrings, and calves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can still enjoy the benefits of this move at your desk even if you can\u2019t get your heels all the way down to the floor.

We have to admit that this pose is one of our favorites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sit tall and place your right ankle over your left knee as you gently push down on your right knee. Hold for 30 seconds, varying the pressure you place on your knee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeat on the other side with your left ankle over your right knee, holding the pose for 30 seconds to fully experience the stretch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/w-ktVNGHTuo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>See the move <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w-ktVNGHTuo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Chair Pose<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Minute 8 (30 seconds): <\/strong>This pose will work your lower body and spine. It seems simple, but it will certainly challenge you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For extra support, you may want to do this move next to a wall until you <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-workout-routines-for-toning-muscles\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">build strength.<\/a> You\u2019ll begin in mountain pose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, lower your body until your thighs are parallel or as near as they can be to the floor.

Wall Sit<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Minute 9:<\/strong> To complete our yoga session, let\u2019s move on to a pose that will challenge your lower body with wall sit. Stand with your back against the wall as you slowly slide down into a sitting position with your thighs parallel to the floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold the position for 60 seconds, but don\u2019t be surprised if you can only stay in this pose for a short time. If you find it difficult, begin with 30 seconds and work your way up to a full minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an excellent way to strengthen your thighs.

Take a few deep inhales and exhales, holding each breath briefly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on your breath and not the work that is waiting for you.
