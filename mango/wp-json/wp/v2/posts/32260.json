<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The symptom list above is a perfect example of what to look for with liver issues. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a history of struggling with any chronic illness this is also a huge sign that you will need liver support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Blood Tests<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is an imbalance with copper, ceruloplasmin, zinc, and iron in blood tests this is a huge sign that the liver is struggling.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ceruloplasmin is a protein that is made in the liver which is essential for proper utilization of copper and iron. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If levels are low then this points to a sluggish and stressed liver.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ask your doctor to order these tests or you can order them yourself though an online lab service like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walkinlab.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Walk In Lab<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis is another way to help with determining the state of the liver.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we are in slow oxidation, it is a big sign that detoxification is very sluggish.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we have a copper imbalance or if we are showing heavy metals, then this also tells us that the liver needs a bit more love. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the main service that I offer myself and I believe <strong>it is one of the most helpful ways to determine the state of our overall health and wellness.&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The practitioner matters the most with HTMA as the test needs to be interpreted correctly to get the most out of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Easy Ways to Support Your Liver<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Dandelion-Tea.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32269\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Dandelion-Tea.png 660w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Dandelion-Tea-300x193.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Dandelion-Tea-20x13.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally like to work on healing and supporting the liver to get it to function better as opposed to harsh cleanses or fasts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most practitioners push their clients to do intense detox cleanses, or they jump right into detoxing instead of nourishment.&nbsp;
