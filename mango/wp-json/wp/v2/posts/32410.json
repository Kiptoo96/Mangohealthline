Frozen Zucchini<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Frozen zucchini is by far my favourite vegetable to put in my smoothies! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>They do not add any flavour at all, and if you peel them, they won\u2019t add colour either. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They act as ice cubes but result in a creamier texture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Tips:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cut your zucchinis into half-inch cubes before freezing them, so they are easier to blend. <\/li><li>You should add \u00bc to \u2153 cup of zucchini in one serving.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Frozen Yellow Squash<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Frozen yellow squash is similar to zucchini but has a yellow peel instead of green. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a good alternative<strong> if you don\u2019t want the hassle of peeling your zucchini<\/strong> and don\u2019t want to see your vegetables in your smoothie bowl.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Tips:<\/strong> <em>(The same recommendations for zucchini apply here)<\/em> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cut your yellow squash into half-inch cubes before freezing them,<\/li><li>and add \u00bc to \u2153 cup per serving.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

Fresh or Frozen Spinach<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Fresh or frozen spinach is your best option if you want to <strong>add copious amounts of vegetables without affecting the flavour<\/strong> of your smoothie. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of its volume, you can fill up \u2153 or even half of your recipe with spinach without tasting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, spinach does have a strong colour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Tips:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You should only add spinach if you are making a green smoothie or another flavour that is already green, such as matcha or mint.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Frozen Beets<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Frozen beets add a beautiful red colour, especially in conjunction with berries. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is for you if you\u2019re looking for a vibrant smoothie bowl to start off your day!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Tips:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>This is the strongest of these five vegetables, so unless you enjoy its flavour, you should keep it to about 2 tablespoons per serving.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Best Protein Sources For Smoothie Bowls<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Greek-Yogurt-and-Raspberries-min.png\" alt=\"Bowl of greek yogurt with raspberries around it, and three berries on top of the yogurt\" class=\"wp-image-32433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Greek-Yogurt-and-Raspberries-min.png 660w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Greek-Yogurt-and-Raspberries-min-300x193.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Greek-Yogurt-and-Raspberries-min-20x13.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.<\/strong> <strong>Yogurt or Plant-Based Yogurt Alternatives<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yogurt or plant-based yogurt alternatives add a lovely creamy texture to smoothies. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Greek yogurts especially are high in protein.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also offer a host of probiotics and micronutrients that are beneficial for your well-being.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Tips:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you opt for dairy yogurt, the <strong>unsweetened yogurt made from whole milk<\/strong> is the best for your health. <\/li><li>They are usually made with minimal ingredients and exclude some of the superfluous additives you may find in flavoured or more processed yogurt. <\/li><li>However, this can differ from brand to brand so be sure to check the ingredients label!<\/li><li>You can add anywhere from \u00bc to \u00bd cup of yogurt, depending on how much yogurt flavour you want in your smoothie bowl.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.<\/strong> <strong>Tofu<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Tofu can also make your smoothie bowl creamier. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a wonderful plant-based protein source and <strong>doesn\u2019t offer the acidic taste often found in yogurts.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Tips:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use about \u00bc block of silken tofu in a smoothie bowl. <\/li><li>When combined with lemon juice, it can also create a cheesecake-like flavour.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.<\/strong> <strong>Protein Powder<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Protein powder can add a variety of fun flavours to your smoothie bowls. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can go for a simple protein powder such as vanilla or one that isn\u2019t flavoured. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people also use creative flavours like mint chip or pumpkin spice, now that we\u2019re approaching the fall season!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best Tips:<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you are adding protein powder for the flavour, a \u00bd scoop should be enough, <\/li><li>but if you want more protein, a full scoop will serve you better.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Best Healthy Fats For Smoothie Bowls<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Avocados-min.png\" alt=\"Display of avocados -

I\u2019m Kaitlyn, a rising junior in high school. I\u2019m a lover of all things food and health, which is why I started my blog <a href=\"https:\/\/happinesscomesintastes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Happiness Comes in Tastes<\/em><\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">As an aspiring dietician, I hope to promote healthy eating in girls and young women. I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m impervious to the widespread diet culture on social media, but unfortunately, body image has been a huge struggle for me. As I continue to strive for a healthy relationship with food, I hope to inspire other girls to do so as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">I share many nutritious and delicious recipes on my blog because healthy eating should be fun and easy! As a busy student, I value convenience and affordability, so all my recipes are enjoyable to make AND eat. Join me on my journey to a happier and healthier lifestyle today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a quick, easy, well-balanced meal, a smoothie bowl is perfect for busy mornings!
