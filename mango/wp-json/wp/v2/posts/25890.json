This also applies to emotional eating!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Listen to Your Body First and Foremost<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Reclining-Bound-Angle-Pose-Yoga-Relaxation-min.jpg\" alt=\"Reclining Bound Angle Pose Yoga Relaxation-min\" class=\"wp-image-27650\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Reclining-Bound-Angle-Pose-Yoga-Relaxation-min.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Reclining-Bound-Angle-Pose-Yoga-Relaxation-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Reclining-Bound-Angle-Pose-Yoga-Relaxation-min-365x243.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Reclining-Bound-Angle-Pose-Yoga-Relaxation-min-355x236.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>When we slow down, breathe, and bring our attention to our bodies, we activate&nbsp;our parasympathetic nervous system (also known as the <em>rest and digest mod<\/em>e for our body).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing this, we help separate our animal brain and desires from our pre-frontal cortex, which helps us make better decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why studies show meditation, yoga, and mindful eating are incredibly effective for those who binge eat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slowing down, chewing your food 20 times before swallowing, and not eating while watching tv or on your phone are all ways to be a more mindful eater.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t into yoga or meditation, try this&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Allow the feelings of desire for junk food. Acknowledge them. Say hello.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t try to fight them and don&#8217;t give in. Just accept what you are feeling and think about why you are feeling it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself these questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Why am I craving this food?<\/li><li>Am I actually hungry? Am I bored?<\/li><li>How will I feel after I eat this food?<\/li><li>Will I immediately regret it?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then give yourself one hour to wait. If at the end of the hour, you&#8217;re still desperate for it, maybe allow yourself to give in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you will be <strong>much more conscious of the decision-making process around this food.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do your best not to give in and begin to break the power the food has over you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Discover Patterns With a Journal<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We all have triggers in our lives that can lead to binging. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>It could be a particular restaurant you visit, a friend you hang out with, or just any time you are on vacation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By journaling your thoughts and walking yourself through the steps that led up to the emotional eating, <strong>you become more mindful of what\u2019s happening<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why <strong>keeping journals and food logs have been proven to help dieters lose weight faster and keep it off.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a short video on&nbsp;emotional and binge eating&nbsp;on our Youtube Channel, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCHqbu8d5NIZ_Mp6H4aejVOg?sub_confirmation=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Health Nerd<\/a>,&nbsp;that you might find helpful!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MGrcv68li0E\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">.<\/span><\/center>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Become a Master of the Salad Question<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of my favorites and it&#8217;s both extremely helpful and extremely infuriating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s very important for you to be able to determine if you&nbsp;are actually hungry or just craving food because you&#8217;re bored.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are you so hungry that you would eat a salad right now instead of [insert food craving here]?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find that the answer, at least with myself, 9 times out of 10 is usually a loud and resounding <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>NO<\/strong><\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insert apple or broccoli or whatever other healthy food you have on hand in your kitchen if it&#8217;s helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if your answer is NO, you know that you don&#8217;t actually need the food. You&#8217;re just bored and <em>wanting<\/em> something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t let it have that power over your decisions. Might as well call it a drug.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Be Aware of the <em>\u201cWhat the Hell\u201d <\/em>Effect<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an actual psychological effect where a small diet slip-up causes people to say <em>\u201c ahh what the hell!\u201d<\/em> and eat everything in sight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of binging often leads to serious and hurtful feelings of shame and guilt afterward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also often associated with bulimia when the shame and guilt gets so bad that someone feels the need to purge the body afterwards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, your <em>mental<\/em> health is at stake far more than your general health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping triggers and temptations out of the house will help you fight this. Keep bad food out of the house. Don&#8217;t grocery shop when you&#8217;re hungry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, <strong>positive self-talk<\/strong> can be effective if you&#8217;re in the midst of a binge-eating session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saying things like, <em>\u201cEvery little bit counts, so I\u2019ll stop eating now.\u201d<\/em> mid-binge can help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Every calorie that you don&#8217;t eat is a calorie saved.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5.
