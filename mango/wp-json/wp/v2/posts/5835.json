In this article, you&#8217;ll learn the <strong>16 most effective yoga poses for flexibility!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexibility has many health benefits, including <strong>healing aches and pains, helping with balance, and injury prevention.<\/strong> &nbsp;Stretching the muscles can also help <strong>relieve tension and stress,<\/strong> which can cause all sorts of problems, including weight gain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These yoga poses for flexibility are broken down into 3 categories: <strong>Hamstrings, Hips, and Back<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are also listed <strong>in order of difficulty,<\/strong> with the easiest and lightest stretches first. &nbsp;Pick an area to work on, and start from the top!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also important because you will increase your flexibility the quickest when the <strong>body is properly warmed up first.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, don&#8217;t jump right into a 30 second stretch on a really tight muscle. &nbsp;Work your way into stretching the muscle by&nbsp;doing other, lighter stretches first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to hold each pose for <strong>at least 30 seconds.<\/strong> &nbsp;Some will need to be repeated on the other side of the body as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to take your flexibility to the next level, work up to holding each pose for <strong>at least 1 minute.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to <strong>set certain days of the week to work on certain muscle groups.<\/strong> &nbsp;It can be <strong>difficult and overwhelming<\/strong> to try to work on all 3 of these muscle groups every single day. You will likely end up not giving enough attention to any of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try performing the yoga poses for flexibility for each muscle group <strong>at least twice per week<\/strong> if you are looking to increase your flexibility fast!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>*Note:&nbsp;This article used to have 16 poses. It has since been modified to 15!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hamstrings<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of &#8220;bends&#8221; in these yoga poses for flexibility. &nbsp;They are by far the <strong>most effective stretches<\/strong> for increasing flexibility in the hamstrings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you begin to get bored practicing them over and over, we suggest you catch up on your favorite TV show to distract you. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a great way to get your stretches in and not feel bored or have excuses to skip them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Downward Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/downward-facing-dog-yoga-pose-for-flexibility.jpg\" alt=\"downward facing dog yoga pose for flexibility\" class=\"wp-image-5856\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great&nbsp;pose to start with, because it helps to open up the legs, shoulders, and chest before you get into some of the deeper stretches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important part of this pose is keeping the back straight. &nbsp;Try practicing it in front of a mirror, and you will likely notice that your lower back is bending.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you practice this pose more and increase the flexibility in your legs, ankles, and hamstrings, you will notice that your back will flatten out over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ground your palms into your mat, and bring the head in a little closer to the knees to increase the stretch in your shoulders and chest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also helps to &#8220;pedal&#8221; the feet in this pose, meaning bringing one foot up on the toes at a time while the other is flat on the ground (a pedaling motion).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold for 30 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Head-to-Knee Forward Bend (Janu Sirsasana)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/head-to-knee-pose-for-flexibility.jpg\" alt=\"head to knee pose for flexibility\" class=\"wp-image-5840\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This poses is a very important pose on the list of yoga poses for flexibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your natural flexibility, you may or may not be able to even touch your feet. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t! If you practice these hamstring stretches 2-3 times per week, you will be pleasantly surprised at how quickly that will change!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, reach as far as you can or use a <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00XB0DP5I\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00XB0DP5I&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=fitincol-20&amp;linkId=JHLRRFHHR6GARWNT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">yoga strap<\/a><\/strong> until you can reach your toes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep the back straight and flat in this pose, because it will increase the stretch in the hamstrings. &nbsp;Try to avoid hunching over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold for 30 seconds. &nbsp;Repeat on the other side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Seated Forward Bend (Paschimottanasana)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/seated-forward-bend-yoga-pose-for-flexibility.jpg\" alt=\"seated forward bend yoga pose for flexibility\" class=\"wp-image-5854\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the same concept as the pose above except with both feet in front of you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can also be done from a standing position, and you should try both after you try the standing half forward bend (farther down this list).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, keep the back as straight as possible when you are leaning forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s more effective to lean forward at the hips rather than at the waist, which leads to hunching over and a lighter stretch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Wide-Angle Seated Forward Bend (Upavistha Konasana)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/wide-angle-seated-forward-bend-for-flexibility.jpg\" alt=\"wide angle seated forward bend for flexibility\" class=\"wp-image-5848\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Spread your legs as wide as you can while still keeping them straight. &nbsp;Place your hands on the ground in front of you, and begin to lean forward at your HIPS, not your waist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you lean forward at your waist, you will end up hunching your back. &nbsp;Keep your back as straight as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will result in you not getting as &#8220;far&#8221; as you would if your back was hunched but keeping a straight back is the proper form and will be more effective in stretching the muscles to increase flexibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This pose can be more effective as an assisted stretch if you have someone that can put a little pressure on your back for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold for 30 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Standing Half Forward Bend (Ardha Uttanasana)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/standing-half-forward-bend-yoga-pose-for-flexibility.jpg\" alt=\"standing half forward bend yoga pose for flexibility\" class=\"wp-image-5850\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going to start sounding like a broken record, but we cannot stress it enough&#8230; Keep your back STRAIGHT while stretching in this pose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to learn this concept in this pose is to practice in front of a mirror.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by standing up straight, and slowly lowering down while trying to arch your back and push your butt up towards the ceiling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the point where your lower back begins to bend, stop and hold the stretch. &nbsp;For many of you, you will likely not even be able to reach your knees at this point. &nbsp;I know I couldn&#8217;t when I first started, but now I can touch the ground!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s another incredibly important asana on the list of yoga poses for flexibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practice the proper form, and you will become more flexible and progress faster!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold for 30 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Wide-Legged Forward Bend (Prasarita Padottanasana)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/wide-legged-forward-bend-yoga-pose-for-flexibility.jpg\" alt=\"wide legged forward bend yoga pose for flexibility\" class=\"wp-image-5849\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, this is the last of the forward bends, we promise. &nbsp;They really are the most effective poses for increasing flexibility in the hamstrings though!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, notice how her back is arched and not hunched at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Begin with your arms straight out in front of you, and work your way towards the floor when you can do so without bending your back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold for 30 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hips<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly enough, hip flexibility is required for a LOT of poses that you wouldn&#8217;t think of in yoga.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s an integral part of the yoga poses for flexibility. Backbends, for instance, require not only flexibility in the back, shoulders, and chest, but also the hips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re also absolutely crucial if you&#8217;re interested in doing splits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These stretches are even more important if you spend most of your time sitting down during the day, which tightens the hip muscles. &nbsp;Practice these 2-3x per week when possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Bound Angle Pose (Baddha Konasana)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/bound-angle-yoga-pose-for-flexibility.jpg\" alt=\"bound angle yoga pose for flexibility\" class=\"wp-image-5847\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring the bottoms of your feet together in front of you, and clasp them with your hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your back straight, and bend forward at the hips, not the waist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your knees likely won&#8217;t touch the ground, but the goal is to eventually have them on the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spend a little time leaning forward like pictured above and some time pressing the knees lightly into the ground as you bend forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold for 30 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Lunge (Anjaneyasana)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/lunge-pose-for-flexibility.jpg\" alt=\"lunge pose for flexibility\" class=\"wp-image-5843\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve likely done a lunge as part of an exercise program before, but it&#8217;s entirely different in yoga. &nbsp;We aren&#8217;t trying to work the <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/beginner-yoga-workout-to-tone-your-booty\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">glute muscles.<\/a> &nbsp;We&#8217;re trying to open the hips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You generally want to keep the front leg at a 90-degree angle, but it&#8217;s also good to move a little in this stretch. &nbsp;It will help to work different areas of the hips. &nbsp;You can lean forward a bit like pictured above, or you can also raise your arms straight above your head and even backward a little bit to stretch the back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top of your&nbsp;back foot is traditionally flat on the floor, but you can try this variation as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This stretch is vital to being able to do the splits. &nbsp;It stretches&nbsp;the inner muscles&nbsp;of the hip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold for 30 seconds, and make sure to repeat on the other side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Pigeon Pose (Kapotasana)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/pigeon-pose-for-flexibility.jpg\" alt=\"pigeon pose for flexibility\" class=\"wp-image-5842\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This pose stretches the outer hip muscles. &nbsp;There are two variations&nbsp;of this stretch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, try it as pictured above. &nbsp;The left leg should be at a 90-degree angle, but beginners will need to start out with it closer to the body. &nbsp;Your right leg should be straight out behind you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Press up through your hands to keep your shoulders back to stretch the lower back as well (you can also hold yourself up using a table or wall). &nbsp;You will likely feel it in the front of your right hip as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the second variation, keep the legs in the same position as the first but bring your chest all the way to the floor (or as close as you can &#8211; this may mean leaning on your forearms for some). &nbsp;This will take the stretch out of the back and even more into the outer left hip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try holding both variations for 30 seconds each before moving on to the other side of the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>10.

Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/cobra-pose-for-flexibility.jpg\" alt=\"cobra pose for flexibility\" class=\"wp-image-5855\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those poses that can be really &#8220;easy&#8221; if you don&#8217;t work properly in it. &nbsp;Make sure that you are challenging yourself to feel the stretch if you want to get anything out of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is NOT actually to straighten your arms in this pose. &nbsp;That can damage your back if you aren&#8217;t careful. &nbsp;Your legs, hips, and even lower ribs should all remain on the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Place your arms in front of you with your elbows bent, and slowly rise up using your shoulders and upper back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Press down on the floor with your hands, but try to focus on lifting with your chest and upper back rather than letting your hands do all the work. &nbsp;You will feel this stretch greatly in your lower back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great pose to warm up the back for some of the more intense stretches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>12.
