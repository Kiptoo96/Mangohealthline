Are you putting in 100% effort, only to see minimal results?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running is good for your heart and lungs. It can be meditative and help you manage stress. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shape.com\/weight-loss\/tips-plans\/5-reasons-running-may-not-help-you-lose-weight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shape Magazine<\/a>, however,<strong> running may not be as effective as you expect if you\u2019re trying to lose weight<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people think that if you want to lose weight, you should focus on cardio. If you want to build muscle, you should focus on lifting weights. This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.womenshealthmag.com\/fitness\/cardio-myths-debunked\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Women\u2019s Health article<\/a> explains why that\u2019s a myth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focusing on only cardio will help you lose fat. It will also burn some muscle. <a href=\"https:\/\/runnersconnect.net\/not-losing-weight-running\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coach Jeff on Running Connect<\/a> says that many runners don\u2019t fuel up properly before or after a run. Therefore, they may be taking in more calories than they\u2019re expending, leading to weight gain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, overtraining can lead you to develop strong cravings for sugar and salt, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/overtraining\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Axe<\/a>. The short, but intense, workouts below can help you burn more fat without burning out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.
