Each one has its own benefits and best uses. Picking the right one can really improve how well it works for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Magnesium Oxide<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/45Yb5Ym\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Magnesium Oxide<\/a> is one of the most commonly available forms of magnesium supplements. Think of it as the go-to option that you&#8217;ll find in most stores. It&#8217;s practical for a number of uses, especially for digestive issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-Oxide-for-digestive-health-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Types of Magnesium Oxide for digestive health\" class=\"wp-image-37415\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-Oxide-for-digestive-health-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-Oxide-for-digestive-health-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-Oxide-for-digestive-health-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-Oxide-for-digestive-health-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-Oxide-for-digestive-health.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits: <\/strong>Where Magnesium Oxide really shines is in dealing with constipation and indigestion. It acts quickly to help move things along in your digestive system, making it a popular choice for these concerns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Downside:<\/strong> The catch is that Magnesium Oxide has a lower absorption rate compared to other types. This means that while it might help with your digestive issues, your body doesn&#8217;t soak up as much of the actual magnesium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magnesium Oxide is your quick and easy solution for certain digestive troubles. But if you&#8217;re concerned about magnesium deficiency and looking to get the most magnesium into your system, you might want to consider other options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Magnesium Citrate<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3Lu7fxH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Magnesium Citrate<\/a> is another popular form of magnesium that&#8217;s especially known for its high absorption rate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Magnesium Oxide, this type is more readily absorbed by your body, which means you get more of magnesium&#8217;s benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-citrate-for-constipation-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Types of Magnesium citrate for constipation\" class=\"wp-image-37404\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-citrate-for-constipation-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-citrate-for-constipation-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-citrate-for-constipation-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-citrate-for-constipation-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Types-of-Magnesium-citrate-for-constipation.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benefits: <\/strong>One of the standout advantages of Magnesium Citrate is its effectiveness in treating constipation.
