This practice isn&#8217;t just about the physical; it&#8217;s deeply rooted in ancient wisdom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re wondering how Ashtanga<a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/exploring-different-styles-of-yoga\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"36506\"> differs from other styles<\/a> like Hatha and Vinyasa, here&#8217;s the scoop: Ashtanga is unique in its disciplined approach.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While other styles let you mix and match poses, Ashtanga lays it all out for you. You follow a predetermined sequence of poses, and each one prepares you for the next.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a progressive build-up that aims to boost not just your flexibility but also your mental acumen. Ashtanga isn&#8217;t your regular yoga\u2014it&#8217;s yoga with a mission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">History of Ashtanga Yoga<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-history-of.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-37352\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga isn&#8217;t something that just popped up overnight or was invented to be the next big wellness trend.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The practice of Ashtanga Yoga&nbsp; has deep historical roots. Originating from an ancient Indian manuscript called the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yogapedia.com\/definition\/6202\/yoga-korunta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yoga Korunta<\/a>, Ashtanga Yoga has quite the backstory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This manuscript was discovered by T. Krishnamacharya, an influential figure in modern yoga, in the early 20th century. He passed on this knowledge to his student K. Pattabhi Jois, who then became the main proponent of Ashtanga Yoga as we know it today.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jois didn&#8217;t just teach it; he also refined and defined the methodology, founding the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute in Mysore, India, in 1948.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be interested to know that it wasn&#8217;t just an Indian phenomenon for long. K. Pattabhi Jois and his disciples brought Ashtanga Yoga to the world&#8217;s attention.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the late 20th century, this form of yoga had spread like wildfire, catching the attention of wellness enthusiasts far beyond the Indian subcontinent.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, you can find Ashtanga Yoga classes pretty much everywhere in the world, from New York to Tokyo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Principles of Ashtanga Yoga<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting to the heart of Ashtanga Yoga, you&#8217;ll find it&#8217;s far more than just a string of poses. This specialized practice is built on key tenets that act like the special sauce, adding that unique flavor and transformative power to your yoga experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Vinyasa-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Ashtanga Yoga Vinyasa\" class=\"wp-image-37353\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Vinyasa-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Vinyasa-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Vinyasa-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Vinyasa-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Vinyasa.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vinyasa<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, let&#8217;s talk about Vinyasa. This is the heartbeat of Ashtanga Yoga. You might have heard the term <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/vinyasa-yoga-finding-your-flow\/\">&#8220;Vinyasa&#8221; thrown around in other yoga<\/a> classes, but here it has a specific role.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s all about flow and synchronization. You link each movement to your breath\u2014so, for example, you extend when you inhale and bend when you exhale.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This practice isn&#8217;t just physically engaging; it also turns each session into a moving meditation. Your breath sets the rhythm, and your body follows. Pretty neat, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tristhana<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next in line is Tristhana. If Vinyasa is the heartbeat, then consider Tristhana the vital signs of your Ashtanga practice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This principle comprises three elements: posture, breathing, and looking place (Drishti).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Posture:<\/strong> This isn&#8217;t just about standing tall or sitting right. It&#8217;s about how you engage your muscles, how you distribute your weight, and how you position your body in each pose.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Breathing:<\/strong> Deep, rhythmic, and controlled\u2014that&#8217;s the kind of breathing we aim for in Ashtanga. It&#8217;s not just inhale-exhale; it&#8217;s about mindful breathing that complements each pose.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Drishti:<\/strong> This is your looking place, your focal point. Whether it&#8217;s the tip of your nose or a point on the horizon, focusing your gaze helps you maintain balance and concentration.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When you get these three elements right, it&#8217;s like hitting the yoga jackpot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bandhas<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bandhas are known as &#8220;energy locks,&#8221; and their role is essentially to act as energy managers during your practice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Bandas-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Ashtanga Yoga Bandas\" class=\"wp-image-37345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Bandas-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Bandas-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Bandas-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Bandas-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-Bandas.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These techniques help you channel your internal energy in a more focused way. By mastering your Bandhas, you\u2019re putting yourself in the driver&#8217;s seat, controlling how energy flows through your body during the practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mula Bandha: The Root Lock<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with Mula Bandha, or the &#8220;root lock,&#8221; this technique is all about grounding your energy. Imagine a string pulling from the base of your spine down to the ground.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To engage Mula Bandha, you tighten the muscles around your pelvic and perineum area. The effect? Enhanced stability and a centered feeling that helps you maintain balance in various poses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Uddiyana Bandha: The Abdominal Lock<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we have Uddiyana Bandha, often termed the &#8220;abdominal lock.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t about <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/get-abs-faster-with-diet-and-exercise\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"29769\">toning your abs<\/a>\u2014though that might be a happy side effect!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real aim is to control your prana, or life energy, by drawing your abdominal muscles towards your spine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engaging Uddiyana Bandha can aid in breath control and offer better support for your spine during more complex poses. Plus, it helps in maintaining the natural curvature of the lower back, reducing the risk of injuries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Jalandhara Bandha: The Throat Lock<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Last on the list is Jalandhara Bandha, or the &#8220;throat lock.&#8221; To engage this, you lower your chin down to your chest in specific poses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is this important? This technique is believed to regulate the circulatory and respiratory systems, slowing down your heart rate and calming your mind.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also helps you maintain focus, particularly when you\u2019re doing poses that require a high level of concentration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Big Three Bandhas that help manage your body&#8217;s energy during Ashtanga Yoga are not just optional add-ons; they are essential elements that elevate your Ashtanga practice from routine exercise to a transformative experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you combine these Bandhas with the other core principles of Vinyasa and Tristhana, you\u2019re not merely practicing Ashtanga Yoga\u2014you\u2019re embodying it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Six Series: Your Ashtanga Progression Path<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving on to the Six Series in Ashtanga Yoga, you&#8217;ll find that each one has a unique set of challenges and benefits. Whether you&#8217;re a beginner or an advanced yogi, there&#8217;s a series that matches your level and keeps you engaged.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-The-Six-Series-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Ashtanga Yoga The Six Series\" class=\"wp-image-37350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-The-Six-Series-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-The-Six-Series-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-The-Six-Series-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-The-Six-Series-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-The-Six-Series.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Primary Series: The Building Blocks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First up is the Primary Series, also known as &#8220;Yoga Chikitsa&#8221; or Yoga Therapy. This is where everyone starts, and for a good reason.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It aims to build a solid foundation by focusing on aligning your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/top-10-reasons-to-detoxify-your-body\/\">body and detoxifying<\/a> your system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This series features poses that improve your flexibility, build muscle strength, and help you understand the basic techniques of Ashtanga Yoga. It\u2019s like learning the alphabet before you start writing sentences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Intermediate Series: The Energy Highway<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next stop is the Intermediate Series, also called &#8220;Nadi Shodhana,&#8221; which means cleansing of the energy channels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This series takes things up a notch by introducing poses that cleanse the nervous system and open up the energy pathways.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Primary Series is about physical alignment, the Intermediate Series aims to align your internal energy. Get ready for deeper backbends, more complicated twists, and a lot of inner work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Four Advanced Series<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, for the yogis who are ready for some serious commitment, the Four Advanced Series await.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are often termed &#8220;Sthira Bhaga,&#8221; which means the state of being that is stable yet joyful. Each of these advanced series has its unique focus and challenge:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-arm-balance-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Ashtanga Yoga arm balance\" class=\"wp-image-37344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-arm-balance-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-arm-balance-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-arm-balance-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-arm-balance-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-arm-balance.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced A:<\/strong> Known for challenging arm balances and playful inversions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advanced B:<\/strong> Introduces complex postures that require deep backbends and challenging forward bends.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advanced C:<\/strong> In this series, prepare to test your limits with some of the most intricate poses in Ashtanga Yoga.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advanced D:<\/strong> This is the pinnacle, featuring poses that only the most dedicated and experienced Ashtangis reach.

Those Chaturangas and Warriors are basically your gym workout in disguise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With consistent practice, you can look forward to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/5-minute-power-yoga-workout-toned-arms\/\">toned arms<\/a>, a strong core, and improved posture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there\u2019s flexibility. The series of poses you\u2019ll go through are designed to stretch your muscles and increase your range of motion over time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if touching your toes seems like an Olympic feat right now, with dedication, you\u2019ll find yourself becoming more limber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let&#8217;s not forget endurance. Completing the various series, especially as they get more challenging, builds up your stamina.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not just muscle stamina, but also cardiovascular health. You&#8217;ll find that you can hold poses for longer periods and your overall energy levels may get a boost too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mental Benefits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-mental-benefits-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Ashtanga Yoga mental benefits\" class=\"wp-image-37349\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-mental-benefits-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-mental-benefits-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-mental-benefits-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-mental-benefits-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-mental-benefits.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching gears to the mental side, Ashtanga Yoga sharpens your focus like a well-aimed arrow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With each pose requiring attention to breathing, posture, and gaze, your multitasking skills get a workout, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relaxation is another mental bonus. Although the practice can be physically demanding, the emphasis on breath and movement synchronization helps you enter a state of flow, easing stress and tension from your mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Spiritual Benefits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, the spiritual. The practice of Ashtanga Yoga fosters a deep sense of mindfulness.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being present in the moment is a cornerstone of the practice. This cultivates an inner awareness that can extend to other areas of your life, making you more attuned to your thoughts and feelings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of Ashtanga Yoga are manifold and holistic, offering something for everyone, whether you&#8217;re focused on physical fitness, mental clarity, or spiritual growth. And that\u2019s what makes this style of yoga so universally appealing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why You Should Give Ashtanga Yoga a Try<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-give-it-a-try-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Ashtanga Yoga give it a try\" class=\"wp-image-37348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-give-it-a-try-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-give-it-a-try-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-give-it-a-try-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-give-it-a-try-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Ashtanga-Yoga-give-it-a-try.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking Ashtanga sounds a bit intense? It\u2019s understandable, but let\u2019s look at why you might want to reconsider.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all, no-flexibility-required situation. Ashtanga offers a level for everyone, and its holistic approach to well-being might just be the thing you didn&#8217;t know you needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Beginner-Friendly<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re new to the yoga scene, Ashtanga has you covered.

Perfect. The Intermediate and Advanced Series offer the variety and challenge that can reinvigorate your existing practice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Ashtanga, you&#8217;re not just repeating the same old poses; you\u2019re advancing and growing. The sequence of poses adds an element of structure that can be refreshing if you&#8217;re used to more freeform practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Full-Body Workout<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you&#8217;re the kind of person who thinks a good <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/at-home-workout-routines-no-equipment-required\/\">workout requires gym equipment<\/a>. If that&#8217;s you, Ashtanga might just change your mind.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s essentially a full-body workout that uses your own body weight as resistance. Say goodbye to dumbbells and hello to poses that challenge your muscles in a whole new way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mental Reboot<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just a physical thing.

Ashtanga&#8217;s emphasis on mindfulness and internal awareness can become a form of moving meditation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re not spiritual, the peace and clarity that come from this focus can be rewarding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Commitment-Friendly<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A busy schedule is no excuse! Ashtanga can be adapted to fit any lifestyle. With practice lengths that can vary, you can commit as much or as little time as you have available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, go ahead and give Ashtanga Yoga a try.
