is the point when they give up.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s the point of dieting and exercising if you aren&#8217;t seeing any results, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrong!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing is, there are almost certainly some benefits happening\u2014you just can\u2019t see them on the scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, if you\u2019ve hit this point in your <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/21-day-diet-challenge-weigh-200-lbs\/\" ><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">weight loss plan<\/span><\/a>, you\u2019re probably wondering what you need to do to get those numbers dropping again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did the research, and found out why you can hit a dreaded weight loss plateau just a couple weeks in\u2014and most importantly, what you need to do to break through it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are Weight Loss Plateaus?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you first start a diet, a quick reduction in pounds is quite normal because chances are, you\u2019ve reduced your calorie intake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\u2019re not counting calories, making simple changes like <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-weight-faster-3-simple-science-approved-steps\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cutting out empty carbs<\/a>, eliminating added <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/cut-down-on-sugar\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sugar<\/a>, and other healthy diet changes can cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without a second thought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Since your body misses those calories, it starts pulling energy from other places. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does this by releasing stores of glycogen, which is a type of carbohydrate that\u2019s found in your liver and in your muscles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glycogen is partly water, and when it\u2019s burned for energy, water is the part that is left over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your body then flushes that excess water out\u2014which is what experts are talking about when they say you \u201close water weight.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you\u2019ll drop several pounds quickly\u2014but when that process is done, it\u2019s done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Then, at the same time that you\u2019re dropping water weight, you\u2019re also losing fat and even a bit of muscle.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since muscle plays a major role in keeping your metabolism revved, your metabolism will slow down a bit with that muscle loss, meaning your body is now burning fewer calories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even if you\u2019re still staying true to your diet, now that your metabolism has slowed a bit, so will your weight loss. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/weight-loss\/in-depth\/weight-loss-plateau\/art-20044615\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is There Anything Good Going On?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if the numbers on the scale have slowed or stopped going down, making healthy lifestyle changes will help your body function better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unhealthy diets cause inflammation, bloating, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/how-hormones-affect-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hormone imbalances<\/a> and a host of other things that cause us to gain weight to begin with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fixing those things will recalibrate your body, and not only help you lose the weight, but <em>keep<\/em> it off, too!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And by the way\u2014just because your scale hasn\u2019t changed, doesn\u2019t mean your inches haven\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you took measurements before you started your diet, now is the time to take them again!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a very good chance that you have actually lost some inches, despite the disappointing numbers on the scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now you have proof that you didn\u2019t just stretch your favorite yoga pants out\u2014they really are getting looser!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tips to Move Past a Weight Loss Plateau<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Go on a Carb Detox<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though you\u2019ve reduced your calories and maybe cut out certain carb-heavy foods like bread or pasta, you\u2019re probably eating more carbs and sugars than you realize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s because a lot of foods that we often think of as healthy\u2014such as fruit, root veggies, white rice, and wheat\u2014are actually packed with simple carbs and sugars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbs and sugars fuel your hormones and can send your insulin, cortisol, thyroxine and everything else through the roof\u2014even if you\u2019re eating them from natural sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The real problem here is that it causes something called <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/insulin-resistance-and-weight-loss\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">insulin resistance<\/span><\/a>, and it means that your body can no longer process <em>any<\/em> carbs properly &#8212; even the healthy ones.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Insulin-Resistance-Diagram.png\" alt=\"Insulin Resistance

loss damn near impossible because you can even eat the right things but if your body can&#8217;t process it properly, it&#8217;s going to hang on to that weight for dear life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, sugars and gluten also cause bloating and water retention, which will also keep the scale from budging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re feeling skeptical, try cutting out all carbs and sugars for a week or two, and see how your body reacts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of our key methods that helps people lose up to <strong>21 lbs in 21 days<\/strong> with our <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"rank-math-link\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a> is a complete carb detox (temporarily), so we know that taking this step will definitely get that scale moving again!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll show you exactly how to detox from those carbs <em>the right way<\/em> &#8212; and how to reintroduce them again to maximize weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Take a Break from Eating<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No, we are not suggesting you starve yourself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re talking about taking small breaks (usually 16 or 24 hours) from eating, otherwise known as <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/intermittent-fasting-for-weight-loss\/\">intermittent fasting<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These scheduled breaks from food will allow your body\u2019s digestive system to rest and will rev your metabolism when you break your fast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s especially powerful when you combine it WITH a detox (as mentioned above), which is a big part of why our clients lose as much as 7-10 pounds in their first WEEK with our <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"rank-math-link\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Intermittent fasting has also been shown to improve hormone balance, reduce muscle loss, and help you naturally eat fewer calories.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people will either fast for 16 hours each day (such as from 8pm until noon the next day), or for 24 hours on a less regular basis (usually from 5pm one day until 5pm the next day).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to eat a big, healthy meal with lots of green veggies when you break your fast to get the most out of your intermittent fasting routine!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Catch Some Z\u2019s<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img

weight isn\u2019t stressful enough, did you know that a lack of sleep can also increase your cortisol levels?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as you just learned, higher levels of cortisol can lead to <em>more fat! <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Even just a little bit of sleep deprivation can impact cortisol,<\/strong> so do everything you can to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/health-benefits-of-sleep\/\">get a full night\u2019s sleep<\/a> every night.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If not, you could be sabotaging your weight loss goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Get Back to (Weight Loss) Basics<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I know this probably isn\u2019t what you want to hear, but the science is sound on this one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The less you weigh, the fewer calories your body needs to fuel it\u2014and you might have already reached a point where<strong> your current calorie intake is the amount it takes to maintain your current weight.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are only two ways around this problem: burn more energy with exercise, or eat fewer calories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To check if your calorie count is what&#8217;s causing your weight loss to stall, use a <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/how-many-calories-for-weight-loss-the-most-accurate-tdee-calculator\/\">TDEE calculator<\/a> to figure out how many calories you should be eating to lose weight at your current size and activity level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then make a plan to either get more active, or reduce your calorie intake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Switch Up Your Routine<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time your muscles will adjust to whatever exercise you are doing, and that exercise becomes less effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve probably reached a comfort zone and you\u2019re thinking that\u2019s great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But if your muscles have gotten comfortable, they\u2019re not likely burning as much fat anymore!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of increasing the intensity of what you\u2019ve been doing, try something completely different, focusing on different muscle groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Increase Your Protein Intake<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thermic effect<\/a> of any food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, your body has to work the hardest to digest protein\u2014and when the body works harder it burns more energy (a.k.a., calories).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if that isn\u2019t good enough on its own, protein contains leucine, an amino acid which studies have shown to be a <strong>catalyst for burning fat.<\/strong>
