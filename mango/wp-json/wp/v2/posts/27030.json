Luckily there are many ways to burn 500 calories without using weights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you are interested in this topic because you want to avoid bulking up while keeping some lean muscle on your body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, <strong>weight lifting isn\u2019t the only way to burn fat and calories.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plenty of physically demanding activities burn way more calories than you would expect, and not all of them require gym equipment. We\u2019ll explain ten ways you can feel the caloric burn without hitting the gym!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, <em><strong>how can we measure how many calories our bodies burn?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals work off calories at different rates based on their weight and the duration of their physical activity, so not everyone will experience the same result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best thing that you can do is <strong>work out for a set period of time that is ideal for your body and your schedule.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While your fitness level, weight, and other individual traits will determine exactly how many calories you will work off, here are ten ways to get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guys, some of these will surprise you, but remember this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is to GET YOURSELF MOVING! Be active in some sort of way. Everyday. This is the key to maintaining a healthy weight and not having to kill yourself in the gym to do it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Go for a long hike.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting outside and energized goes a long way in jump starting your caloric reduction. Hiking isana inexpensive (or free hobby) that people of any skill level can start enjoying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting outside will also give you a healthy dose of <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2vsTAjW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Vitamin D,<\/a> a nutrient that most people are deficient in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/hiking-to-burn-500-calories-min.jpg\" alt=\"hiking to burn 500 calories\" class=\"wp-image-27100\" title=\"hiking to burn 500 calories\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/hiking-to-burn-500-calories-min.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/hiking-to-burn-500-calories-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/hiking-to-burn-500-calories-min-365x243.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/hiking-to-burn-500-calories-min-355x236.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>From flat trails with few challenges to steep terrain with breathtaking views, hiking gives a seriously refreshing <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/the-ultimate-guide-to-at-home-workouts-for-women\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">out-of-gym experience<\/a>. You can also burn some SERIOUS calories doing it (think hiking uphill).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/hikingscience.blogspot.com\/p\/calculate-calories-burned_22.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hiking Science<\/a> offers a dynamic calculator that hikers use to estimate calories burned. For example, for <strong>a 150-pound hiker who travels six miles with no elevation gain burns over 500 calories.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s great about hiking is it\u2019s customizable for every individual&#8217;s comfort level, whether that\u2019s 5000-foot peak hikes or leisurely lakeside trails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and it&#8217;s usually FREE (unless you have to pay park fees).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Take an aerobics class.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While signing up for aerobics class might require a trip to your local gym, it will keep you away from the <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2vxnzFS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">dumbbells<\/a>. As <a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/diet-and-weight-loss\/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-of-leisure-and-routine-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard Health Publications<\/a> notes, all levels of aerobics slough off comparable calories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 30-minute aerobics session, whether step or regular high-impact, <strong>a 155-pound person works off around 260 calories.<\/strong> That means that in one hour, you\u2019ve easily exceeded the 500-calorie goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High impact step aerobics burns the most calories per hour while teaching an aerobics class burns fewer calories but still peaks at over 400.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also don&#8217;t HAVE to go to the gym to do aerobics. You can do <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/at-home-workout-routines-no-equipment-required\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">workouts from home<\/a> like the one below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tj9d6aBOzDo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Hop on the elliptical.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In-home or at your gym, jumping on the elliptical gives you a whole-body workout that burns over 330 calories per half hour. <strong>In about 45 minutes, those 500 calories are history,<\/strong> according to Harvard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2vx2IlP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Ellipticals<\/a> are great for cardio workouts since they get your heart pumping in a hurry.

Get out and run.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people think that the ultimate calorie zapping activity is running.

Then start toning the muscle groups this exercise activates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Shovel snow.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Another productive task makes the list!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoveling snow burns between <strong>400 and 600 calories per hour.<\/strong>&nbsp;That&#8217;s almost double the calories that the average aerobics class&nbsp;burns! Great news if you experience winter blizzards that keep you from getting to the gym!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoveling snow is a lot like lifting weights since snow is technically hefty. But getting outside and up close with nature earns points for your mental and physical health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, this exercise is a <strong>necessary activity for many people who live in colder climates.<\/strong> Why pay for a gym membership when you have your personal gym outside your front door?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Chase some children.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Playing with kids also ranks on WebMD\u2019s list. They recommend engaging with kids and mimicking children\u2019s natural energy. Get down on the floor, roll around, spin, climb, and jump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Not only will you clock more hours of exercise, but you\u2019ll also have fun with your kids (or someone else\u2019s).<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, lifting an infant (or toddler, or preschooler) counts as an upper body workout too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most parents pass hours actively chasing their kids or engaging in imaginative play, especially outdoors. Make a conscious effort to increase your participation in games kids play daily, and torch those calories!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your activity level, <strong>child care burns 300 to 600 calories every hour.<\/strong> 45 minutes to 500 calories down is easy with kids in tow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9.
