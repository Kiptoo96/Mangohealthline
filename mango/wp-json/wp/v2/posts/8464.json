Not getting enough sleep is linked to weight gain.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that <strong>lack of sleep is one of the largest risk factors in obesity<\/strong>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a short study on sleep duration, researchers found that adults not getting enough sleep were 55% more likely to be obese.&nbsp;Worse than that, children were actually 89% more likely to obese when not getting enough sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lack of sleep\u2019s association with <a href=\"https:\/\/thehealthnerds.com\/how-to-lose-belly-fat-fast-6-proven-steps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">fat accumulation<\/span><\/a> seems to be for a number of factors, many of which are listed below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Getting the right amount of sleep improves your hormones.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cortisol, your <a href=\"https:\/\/thehealthnerds.com\/ways-to-relieve-stress-backed-by-science\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">stress<\/span><\/a> hormone, is lowered with the right amount of sleep. &nbsp;Elevated levels of this hormone over time is associated with <strong>poor skin quality, obesity, and a&nbsp;long list of other issues.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better sleep has also been shown to <strong>improve insulin sensitivity<\/strong> and <strong>raise testosterone levels,<\/strong> which will give you <strong>more natural energy<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Good sleep improves your immune system.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another health benefit of sleep is helping you fight off being sick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent study, they found that people who sleep less than 7 hours a night are <strong>3x more likely to develop a cold<\/strong> than those sleeping 8 hours or more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Sleep helps to improve learning skills.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Swiss University study, two groups were introduced to a new language, one right before bed and one during the daytime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The group that&nbsp;slept immediately after learning new material learned the language quicker than those learning in the day time.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So studying before bed seems to be a good idea!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Sleep lowers the risk of developing depression.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/good-night-sleep-for-weight-loss-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"good night sleep for weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-5642\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In a study of twins, researchers found that shorter periods of sleep <strong>increased the genetic risk of developing depression.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, it has been estimated that 90% of patients with depression also suffer from some form of sleep apnea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. People who get more sleep naturally eat less.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you don\u2019t get enough sleep, the fluctuations of hormones cause <strong>greater cravings and weaker&nbsp;appetite control.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s trying to lose weight but just can\u2019t stay away from the late-night snacks, getting more sleep is something that can probably help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Sleep helps us empathize with others.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another strange health benefit of sleep is a better <strong>understanding of social cues.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One study found that those who are sleep-deprived lose the ability to properly recognize expressions of anger and happiness in the faces of others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Sleep improves athletic performance.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a study of basketball players, a better night\u2019s rest <strong>improved the reaction times, speed, and, the accuracy<\/strong> of the players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another study of over 2,800 women, lack of sleep made them more sluggish and made it difficult to perform tasks that required coordination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve discussed the health benefits of sleep, let&#8217;s talk about how to get a better night&#8217;s rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5 Tips to Get Better Sleep<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/shutterstock_193585202-1.jpg\" alt=\"woman in bed, feet-first view\" class=\"wp-image-3186\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/shutterstock_193585202-1.jpg 400w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/shutterstock_193585202-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/shutterstock_193585202-1-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Use blackout curtains and duct tape to blackout your room.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Melatonin<\/strong>, also known as the sleep hormone, is raised when the sun goes down to indicate to our bodies that it\u2019s time to rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that street lights, outlets, and all sorts of other unnatural lights confuse this hormone and trick it into thinking it\u2019s still daytime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do a <strong>complete blackout of your room<\/strong>, and you will notice a BIG difference in both quality of sleep and ability to get to sleep.&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00N70FNPM\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=theheaner-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00N70FNPM&amp;linkId=5f179e74a8768ab680b20172f4f42935\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Blackout curtains<\/span><\/a> are the best way to accomplish this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, computer screens and phone screens confuse melatonin as well. &nbsp;There are <strong>nighttime modes<\/strong> on these devices, but it\u2019s always best to just not use them 1 hour before bedtime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.

Use your bed for nothing but sleep and the occasional\u2026 physical activity.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This goes&nbsp;with the habit thing, but the moment you hit the bed, you want the body to recognize that it\u2019s time to fall asleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get in the habit of only using your bed for <strong>sleep and sex<\/strong>, and&nbsp;try not to work on your bed or spend any time on it when you\u2019re not resting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Use a pillow between or underneath your legs.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help to <strong>maintain the alignment of your back<\/strong> and <strong>improve your posture<\/strong> over time. &nbsp;It will also help those of you suffering from lower back pain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is not a perfect way to sleep, but on your back is probably best as it helps to maintain the alignment of your neck and spine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Nap more.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A short 20-30 minute nap <strong>lowers cortisol levels<\/strong> and is very healthy for the body. &nbsp;So bring back a little bit of your childhood and do a quick cat nap if feeling tired midday!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our last point is that the right amount of time for optimal sleep benefits is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>7-9 hours per night<\/strong><\/span>. &nbsp;No less than 7 and no more than 9 is the perfect amount!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course, getting adequate sleep&nbsp;isn\u2019t the only piece you need for <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fast and effective weight loss.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leave me a comment below if you enjoyed this article on the importance of sleep or have any questions!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today we\u2019re going to talk about the importance of sleeping and the 10 scientific health benefits of sleep. &nbsp;We\u2019re also going to finish with some proven sleeping tips that will ensure you get a full night\u2019s rest and make sure you get the right amount.
