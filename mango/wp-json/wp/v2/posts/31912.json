insulin resistant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that insulin resistance is reversible, even if you have already developed type II diabetes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, most people get overwhelmed by all the lifestyle changes necessary to reverse insulin resistance\u2014especially if you\u2019ve never successfully dieted or worked out on a regular basis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you discovered your

resistance<\/a> through your doctor, they probably recommended cutting back on sugars and carbs, and increasing your exercise\u2014which sounds simple enough, but trying to figure out exactly what to focus on can quickly feel overwhelming and stressful.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insulin resistance is scary and has a major impact on your health and everyday life, so it is not something you want to take your time fixing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get a lot of questions from our readers wondering what the fastest way is to reverse insulin resistance, <strong>and whether you should focus on your diet, exercise, or both\u2014especially at the beginning.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I get that healthy lifestyle changes can feel overwhelming and difficult, especially since some of the hallmark symptoms of insulin resistance are fatigue, brain fog, and strong food cravings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Factor in the encyclopedia of information from your doctor, friends and family, and WebMD, and it\u2019s easy to enter information overload.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you\u2019re feeling frozen in place, or too overwhelmed to figure out where to start, you\u2019re not alone\u2014and you\u2019re in the right place.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We\u2019ve talked a lot about the way <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-weight-insulin-resistance-diet\/\"  aria-label=\"diet impacts insulin sensitivity (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">diet impacts insulin sensitivity<\/a>, but we haven\u2019t talked nearly as much about exercise.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercise is crucial to overall well being, and it\u2019s something that many people overlook when they first try to address their insulin resistance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But burning glucose and improving your cardiovascular health is very important in the battle against insulin resistance\u2014<strong>possibly even more important than your diet.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll share exactly what happens in your body when you exercise, how that affects your insulin sensitivity, and whether or not you need both exercise and diet to reverse your insulin resistance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let\u2019s go over <strong>why exercise and movement are so important to your health<\/strong>, including your insulin sensitivity\u2014and what happens if you don\u2019t do enough of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Exercise Affects Insulin Levels<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div

important for your health, and definitely necessary if you want to look good in your swimsuit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when it comes to insulin resistance, <strong>many people automatically think of diet<\/strong>\u2014cutting out sugary foods and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/carb-detox-to-lose-weight\/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">carbs<\/a>, and adding in fiber and protein.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, exercise is just as important to consider when addressing insulin resistance, since the entire purpose of glucose and insulin is to get glucose from food into your muscles so you can burn it as energy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let\u2019s take a look at what happens when you don\u2019t exercise or move enough, and how simply getting enough exercise can impact your insulin resistance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Happens When You Don\u2019t Move Enough&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure

desk or on the sofa, you know that sitting too long can leave you feeling stiff, sore and achy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a lot more is happening inside your body when you skip out on exercise, especially if you\u2019re chronically sedentary\u2014and none of it is good.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even just one week of bedrest has been shown to send otherwise healthy, insulin sensitive people temporarily into insulin resistance.
