Decreases your risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures.<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Osteoporosis is a disease that causes your bones to become thin and weak as you age. The biggest complication of osteoporosis is bone fractures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately women achieve their peak bone mass in their 20\u2019s, and begin to show signs of decline shortly after. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3383520\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Osteoporosis becomes most prevalent in post-menopausal women as estrogen levels fall sharply.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-workout-routines-for-toning-muscles\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"26709\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">resistance training<\/a> can help decrease bone fracture risk by improving your bone mass and helping to maintain your bone density. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6279907\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Decreases your risk of injury<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Engaging in regular physical activity will also strengthen your ligaments, joints, and muscles, which is useful for injury prevention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is especially true of the core muscles and hip joint.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A weakened core is a major reason for low back pain in the middle-aged population.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Improves mood, self-esteem, &amp; self confidence<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercise has been shown to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/sleep-stress-insulin-resistance\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"31176\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">positive effect on mood<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That\u2019s because exercise:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>causes the release of endorphins (the feel good hormone),<\/li><li>can improve blood flow and circulation which keeps our cells and brain well oxygenated<\/li><li>gives you a sense of accomplishment<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies have even shown exercise to be effective for depression. (<a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/21495519\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Improves posture<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you suffer from neck pain, upper back or low <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-asanas-strengthen-back\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27026\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">back pain<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A very likely culprit is your posture.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercise can help to combat the effects of bad posture by strengthening underused muscles that help keep your body healthy and your posture straight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes the core muscles, glutes, and back muscles!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Helps build lean muscle and lower body fat percentage<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, exercise will help you build lean muscle tissue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a natural loss of muscle that happens as we get older and restrict our activity levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thankfully, resistance training can reverse this, while improving your metabolism!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, exercise can contribute to a reduction in body fat percentage (although your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-100-pounds-simple-diet\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27467\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nutrition<\/a> will always be more important).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know why you need to work out, let\u2019s talk about how to get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2

workout, you must learn how to perform the <strong>6 key functional movement patterns:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Hip extension exercises<ul><li>Example: glute bridge and dumbbell deadlift variations<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Knee flexion exercises <ul><li>Example: squats and lunges<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Vertical pushing exercises<ul><li>Example: shoulder press and similar movements<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Vertical pulling exercises <ul><li>Example: pull downs and pull ups<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Horizontal pushing exercises <ul><li>Example: push-ups and dumbbell pressing<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Horizontal pulling exercises <ul><li>Example: dumbbell rows<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is, there are many different exercise variations to train these 6 movement patterns. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to find a variation that is suitable to your skill level and that you can do with proper technique.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I go over several of these exercises along with sample routines over on my blog, <a href=\"https:\/\/postpartumtrainer.com\/postpartum-fitness\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Postpartumtrainer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To get started, I want you to perform one exercise from each of these movement patterns 1-2 times per week.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which leads me to my next point&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Much Exercise Should a 35 Year Old Woman Do?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure

training.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend that you try to do <strong>resistance training 3-4 times a week, 20-30 minutes per session.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that this might sound like a lot, but 20-30 minutes is very doable!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to <strong>have a set plan in place<\/strong> for how you are going to approach your workouts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One simple way to tackle this is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>going on a 30 minute walk three times per week, and&nbsp;<\/li><li>doing three 30 minute strength training sessions per week<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One workout can be focused on upper body pushing exercises, the other on upper body pulling exercises, and the third one on the lower body and core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want you to go into each workout with a plan in place so that your workout can be efficient yet effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you can&#8217;t make it to the gym, most of the exercises mentioned above can be done at home with a set of <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3fyTCgK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">dumbbells<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3jsj1tJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">resistance bands<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Exercises Should You Avoid?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The only type of exercise you should avoid are ones that cause you pain, discomfort, or ones that you cannot perform with proper technique.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many variations to each movement pattern, you can always find an alternative to train the proper muscle groups safely and effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are ever unsure, speak with a licensed trainer for personal recommendations for you and your body.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3
