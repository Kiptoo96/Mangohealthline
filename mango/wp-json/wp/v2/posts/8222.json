Treat yo\u2019self!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok, so you don\u2019t want to hang a Little Black Dress on your wall to motivate you. &nbsp;<strong>No biggie<\/strong>. &nbsp;You can find <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sparkpeople.com\/resource\/motivation_articles.asp?id=1990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">other ways to splurge<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Set a specific weight loss goal<\/strong> (say, 5 pounds). Once you\u2019ve met that small, attainable goal, buy yourself something nice. Here are a few ideas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Go to a movie.<\/li><li>Put $5 in your vacation fund.<\/li><li>Buy yourself a new pair of shoes.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re ready to <strong>up the ante<\/strong>, consider making your goals 10 or more pounds at a time. &nbsp;Of course, the rewards increase with the accomplishment!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get a massage.<\/li><li>Go to dinner with a friend.<\/li><li>Buy some new clothes!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever reward you choose, it should be something that would actually make <strong>you<\/strong> want to lose the pounds!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Have some friendly competition.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, so you\u2019re an avid gamer or competitive hot dog eater?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to put that winning attitude to good use!

Charting your weight loss can be helpful for this, as you can see the downward trend over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Make new friends!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If getting a buddy or joining a weight loss challenge is not in the cards for you, another great way to gain support is to join a workout class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t just join the one you think you should join; make it a fun class!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bond that is built while sweating together is the perfect encouragement you need to make it to your goals. You\u2019ll look forward to seeing your buds in class, and will be less likely to skip your workout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Have a maintenance plan in place.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve reached your end goal, be sure to have a maintenance plan ready.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While losing the weight can be hard, keeping it off can be even tougher!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By knowing that you\u2019re prepared to maintain your hard-won weight loss, you\u2019ll have an even bigger push to keep the momentum going.
