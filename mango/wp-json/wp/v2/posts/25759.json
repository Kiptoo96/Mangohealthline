Take a Break From Exercise (For Now)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoaaaaa, what!? Let me explain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercise is fantastic for you and should absolutely be a part of everyone&#8217;s healthy lifestyle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you weigh 200 pounds and have more than 100 of that to lose, <strong>exercise should NOT be your main focus right now.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most weight loss plans also put you on an intensive exercise routine to go along with it and all it ends up doing is <strong>stressing out your joints and wearing out your willpower.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/joint-pain-exercising-over-200-pounds.jpg\" alt=\"joint pain exercising over 200 pounds\" class=\"wp-image-25763\" title=\"joint pain exercising over 200 pounds\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/joint-pain-exercising-over-200-pounds.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/joint-pain-exercising-over-200-pounds-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/joint-pain-exercising-over-200-pounds-365x244.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/joint-pain-exercising-over-200-pounds-355x237.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Our clients <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">lose 10-21 pounds in 21 days<\/span><\/a> without any exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, we do recommend daily walks because they&#8217;re great for your health for a variety of reasons, but no intensive exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the reason for this <strong>diet plays FAR more of a role than exercise does when it comes to weight loss.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, a recent study done by Current Biology took 322 adults from 5 different countries through a calorie reduction weight loss program. &nbsp;They split the groups between those that did exercise and those that did not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shockingly enough,&nbsp;adding in exercise did not play ANY major role over calories burned or weight lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;And for those that saw changes, they were minor at best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phrase &#8220;you can&#8217;t outrun a bad diet.&#8221; is 100% true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>First, you need to focus on getting your diet on track.

You should acknowledge it. Don&#8217;t let it have power over you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Binge eating and emotional eating can be very dangerous, but even more so when you do it subconsciously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Dr. Michael Mantell from <a href=\"https:\/\/greatist.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Greatist<\/span><\/a>&nbsp;found that there were <strong>5 main negative emotional factors that cause binge and emotional eating:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Stress<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Anxiety<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Depression<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Dopamine (searching out rewards from boredom)<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Community Peer Pressure<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Tackling these is crucial to fast weight loss success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the ways that you can combat this is to not go through this process alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Find a support system, whether it be a friend, your family, or a community.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our weight loss program comes with access to a community full of women that are going through the diet challenge together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that you have the help and support that you need every step of the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.
