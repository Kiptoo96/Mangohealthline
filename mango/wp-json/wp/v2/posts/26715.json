No amount of exercise, dieting, or healthy meals appears to be working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sudden decrease in weight loss may not have anything to do with your effort. In reality, it may have everything to do with your body\u2019s hormones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait a minute. <em>What do hormones have to do with weight loss?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hormones control <em>a lot <\/em>of functions in our bodies, from immunity to behaviors. How we think, act, stay motivated, and even how our internal processes work all boil down to good old hormones.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, yes, they have control over our weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re having problems losing weight, you may want to check with your doctor to rule out a possible hormone issue. Don\u2019t worry, though \u2013 it is possible to reset your body and get those stubborn hormones back on track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Do Hormones Do to Our Bodies?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hormones are small control units of our bodies. Think of them like little delivery people that send important communications to every area of our bodies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>They control our emotions, tell us when to grow, ramp up the immune system when necessary, and help develop our body systems.<\/strong> They even coordinate information between systems to make sure everything functions properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, not all cells get affected by every hormone. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/pages\/frontline\/shows\/nature\/etc\/hormones.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PBS<\/a>, hormones only interact with the cells that have receptors for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s kind of like a magnet. If you put them together the right way, they attract each other; if you try to change the position of one, they push each other apart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Causes Hormone Imbalances?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can affect the natural cycle of hormones.<\/em> These sneaky guys can pretend to be a receptor for a hormone or block the hormone\u2019s pathway altogether.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results are out-of-whack body systems and hormone imbalances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A hormone imbalance can also occur from an unhealthy lifestyle, like a poor diet or lack of activity.<\/strong> Of course, natural body changes that occur with aging, like menopause, can also be culprits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Hormones Affect Weight Loss<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hormones obviously have a lot of control over our bodies. Unfortunately, they also have the power to inhibit our weight loss once they get thrown off course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hormones control everything that leads to weight loss: the amount of muscle you gain, how energetic you feel, and your metabolism, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re not losing weight, you could have a hormonal imbalance that\u2019s affecting one or more of these body processes.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take, for example, <strong>insulin<\/strong>. Tis hormone is one of the most important for keeping your metabolism on track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If your body has an insulin imbalance, which happens to those with diabetes, your body can lose energy, gain weight, have trouble breaking down food, and raise blood sugar.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"262\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/high-insulin-can-cause-PCOS.jpg\" alt=\"high insulin can cause weight gain\" class=\"wp-image-26781\" title=\"high insulin can cause weight gain\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/high-insulin-can-cause-PCOS.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/high-insulin-can-cause-PCOS-300x157.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/high-insulin-can-cause-PCOS-365x191.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/high-insulin-can-cause-PCOS-355x186.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You may notice that when you become stressed, you have a more difficult time losing weight. <em>Why?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stress can inhibit effective weight loss hormones and signal not-so-healthy hormones to start working.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your hormones could even trigger <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/stop-binge-eating-and-emotional-eating\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unhealthy snacking habits<\/a> and a lack of energy that keeps you from working out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other hormonal balances, which several factors can cause, may also to blame. A Rutgers study showed that when certain hormones were depressed in lab mice, they ate foods high in fat and bigger portions than usual (<a href=\"http:\/\/news.rutgers.edu\/research-news\/overeating-caused-hormone-deficiency-brain\/20150721#.WSV9tGjysdV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Weight Gain Hormones to Watch<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some hormones are nicknamed \u201cweight gain hormones\u201d because of their ability to contribute to weight gain when they\u2019re overactive. Here are a few important weight gain hormones to know about:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Reverse T3<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/08\/05\/how-to-fix-your-hormones-and-lose-weight\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Mark Hyman<\/a> explains that Reverse T3 is often <strong>the hormone that keeps the thyroid hormone from working properly,<\/strong> leading to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-weight-with-hypothyroidism\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hypothyroidism<\/a>. Hypothyroidism is one of the leading causes of weight gain, especially in women.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reverse T3 can become active when the &#8220;normal&#8221; hormone, T4, gets affected by chronic stress, unhealthy dieting, chronic alcohol or drug abuse, or other significant changes in your body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Cortisol<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/cortisol-that-causes-belly-fat.png\" alt=\"cortisol that causes belly fat and is a hormone that affects weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-5926\" title=\"cortisol that causes belly fat and is a hormone that affects weight loss\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another hormone that becomes overly-active from <strong>high levels of stress or mental health challenges.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cortisol is responsible for increased appetite, little energy, and even a loss of muscle mass. Your weight loss can suffer dramatically from increased cortisol levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Estrogen<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, ladies. We have plenty of the naturally-occurring <strong>estrogen<\/strong> that makes us female.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, estrogen is also <strong>one of the leading causes of weight gain.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Estrogen then causes more <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-belly-fat-fast\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fat to sit around your abs,<\/a> making it harder to lose weight. You may also lose muscle mass and gain weight around the hip area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Balance Your Hormones to Promote Weight Loss<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what can you do to combat wacky hormones and get your weight loss back on track?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can reset your body to regain healthy hormone levels, and <em>it doesn\u2019t always require a visit to the doctor.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Resetting your body is all about reaching healthy levels of weight gain hormones by counteracting them with weight loss hormones. Here\u2019s how to do it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. De-Stress. <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/stress-hormone-affects-weight-loss.jpg\" alt=\"stress hormones affects weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-26943\" title=\"stress hormones affects weight loss\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/stress-hormone-affects-weight-loss.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/stress-hormone-affects-weight-loss-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/stress-hormone-affects-weight-loss-365x244.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/stress-hormone-affects-weight-loss-355x237.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first, you need to <strong>find ways to relax.<\/strong> Stress is the number one cause of hormonal imbalances, and you may not realize the impact it has on your weight loss until you find yourself 20 pounds heavier.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make time for yourself throughout the day, whether it\u2019s a quick <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/walking-to-lose-weight\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10-minute walk<\/a> on your lunch break or a long bath after work. You are an important factor in your weight loss success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Sleep well.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology showed that chronic sleep loss leads to increased insulin production and other factors that disturb metabolism (<a href=\"http:\/\/jap.physiology.org\/content\/99\/5\/2008.short\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch your caffeine intake throughout the day and especially near bedtime.
