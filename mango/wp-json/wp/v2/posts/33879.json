knee pain from exercise, it\u2019s important to figure out the root cause of the issue. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some modes of exercise are more stressful on the knee than others.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, running (or jogging) is one of the most common activities people use to start exercising again. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s simple, free, and easy to perform almost anywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if knee pain is keeping you from tying up your laces, consider a new mode of exercise. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to stay active, so find a few cross-training activities that will get your heart rate up but also bring your knee pain down. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Even if you aren\u2019t experiencing knee pain, it\u2019s always good to mix up your routine with some cross-training.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Yoga<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Performing <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/fat-burning-yoga-workout-for-beginners\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7905\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">30 minutes of yoga<\/a> is a great way to vary your exercise

low-impact movements you can perform when rehabbing your knee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Biking<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good, low-impact activity is biking. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will strengthen the quads and give your knees a break from high-impact exercises such as running or jumping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rowing<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With rowing, you can build strength in your lower extremities without pounding the pavement. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rowing is also a great cardio exercise and an excellent challenge for
