You could use a couch if that\u2019s your only option; but for proper form, we suggest sticking to something solid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll want to make sure that whatever you use for this exercise won\u2019t move, so push whatever you\u2019re using up against the wall to keep it from sliding away or tipping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this exercise, sit down on and wrap your hands around the front of the seat with your knuckles facing forward. Then, slide your rear end off the front of the seat and extend your arms to hold yourself up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, slowly lower your body until the elbows bend to a 90-degree angle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dip your body down and up for about 30 seconds three times resting about 30 seconds to a minute between sets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re struggling to do this one, you can <strong>bend your knees a bit more<\/strong> and put your feet flat, which will transfer some of the weight from your arms to your feet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

Then raise your arms, bend your elbow so that arms are at a 90-degree angle, with your hands in front of your face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Punch forward with your right arm until it\u2019s straight with your palm facing the floor. Then pull it back to it\u2019s starting position. Repeat with the left arm to complete one repetition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, continue punching forward, alternating your arms between punches for 60 seconds.
