but just know that even if it feels difficult at first, cutting carbs out of your diet is perfectly healthy (<em>and arguably much healthier than continuing to eat excess carbs every day!<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What You Should Eat<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best foods to eat during a carb detox are high protein and high fiber foods, like lean meat, eggs, and vegetables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also eat healthy fats, like avocados, olives, and healthy cooking oils.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These foods are filling and digest slowly, which will help keep cravings at bay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some of the best foods include during your detox:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Broccoli, spinach, kale, or other leafy green veggies<\/li><li>Summer squash or spaghetti squash<\/li><li>Salmon, tilapia, or other healthy fish<\/li><li>Chicken, turkey or lean beef<\/li><li>Protein powder with less than two grams of carbs per serving<\/li><li>Nuts and seeds (except for peanuts)<\/li><li>Flavorful herbs, onions, garlic, and low-salt, carb-free seasonings<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What You Shouldn\u2019t Eat<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though you may think of these as healthy foods, beans and starchy veggies, like potatoes and peas, have a fairly high carb content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fruit, sweet potatoes and quinoa are also higher carb, even though they have lots of extra fiber. For the purpose of a detox, you should stay away from those kinds of foods for the first week at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll also need to avoid the more obvious foods, like grains, breads and cereals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Foods to avoid during your detox:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>All fruit, except for avocados and olives<\/li><li>Bread, rice, oats, and other grains<\/li><li>Starchy veggies and legumes, including potatoes, beans and peas<\/li><li>Higher carb, fibrous foods, like sweet potatoes, quinoa, wild rice, brown rice<\/li><li>All processed foods, even if they are labelled as healthy or low-carb<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Root veggies, like carrots and beets, have a higher sugar content than other veggies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We suggest staying away from these during your carb detox, but some sources suggest the fiber and other compounds found in some root veggies can actually help remove the excess sugars from your bloodstream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, root veggies are iffy at best. If you can go without them, please do!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What to do After your Detox<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Healthy-Food-After-the-Carb-Detox.png\" alt=\"After the Carb Detox, Healthy Low-Carb Foods\" class=\"wp-image-30892\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Healthy-Food-After-the-Carb-Detox.png 660w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Healthy-Food-After-the-Carb-Detox-300x193.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Healthy-Food-After-the-Carb-Detox-365x235.png 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Healthy-Food-After-the-Carb-Detox-355x229.png 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>After your detox, you can\u2019t just go back to the way you were eating before. This will quickly undo all of your hard work!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should slowly integrate carbs back into your diet, starting with one serving of healthy, complex carbs per day, such as a small sweet potato, or half a cup of wild or brown rice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those portions are roughly 25 grams of carbs, which shouldn&#8217;t spike your blood sugar as long as you stick to complex carbs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can then start to add other complex carbs back in, such as berries, whole grains, and unsweetened diary, as long as most of your food consists of lean protein and vegetables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you\u2019re feeling pretty great without eating carbs,<strong> feel free to stay off of them for as long as you want!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just make sure you get enough calories and protein from other healthy food sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, <strong>you don\u2019t need to eat carbs every single day<\/strong>\u2014<em>especially if you want to lose weight quickly.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We suggest having a serving of carbs on days when you work out, and staying away from them on days when you\u2019re more sedentary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, continue to avoid processed foods, breads, white rice, and other \u201cquick\u201d carbs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to splurge every once in a while, like at a party or a holiday, that\u2019s perfectly fine!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just make sure to balance that splurge with several days of low- or no-carb foods, and plenty of protein and fiber\u2014and don\u2019t make \u201ccheating\u201d a habit, or you could quickly end up with insulin resistance and carb addiction again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related Detox Articles:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a
