They are all too common, especially for beginners!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Underestimating what yoga can do for you. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Yoga is one of the most underestimated fat-burning exercises in the world today. It has been proven in conclusive studies to help people lose weight, control their cravings, lower their stress levels, and help build lean, calorie-burning muscle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"287\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/shutterstock_2467010771.jpg\" alt=\"Underestimating what yoga can do for you\" class=\"wp-image-4937\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/shutterstock_2467010771.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/shutterstock_2467010771-300x172.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/shutterstock_2467010771-365x210.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Skipping relaxation.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Relaxation allows the muscles to relax and cortisol levels to come down. This will allow for greater fat burning and faster results. Don\u2019t skip it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Not doing the right poses for your goals. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Different poses have different purposes. Some will help with <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-poses-for-flexibility\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">flexibility<\/a>, and some will help you <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/fat-burning-yoga-workout-for-beginners\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">burn tons of calories.<\/a> Know the differences and which ones are best for your goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Not having a workout schedule. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just doing random yoga workouts is not the path to finding success in weight loss. Find a program that has a schedule you can keep up with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Holding your breath. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When losing weight, 81% of the fat cells are exhaled through your breath. Make sure to breathe deeply through your poses for best results!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"386\" height=\"292\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/shutterstock_251398867.jpg\" alt=\"mistakes beginners make in yoga when trying to lose weight\" class=\"wp-image-4939\" title=\"mistakes beginners make in yoga when trying to lose weight\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/shutterstock_251398867.jpg 386w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/shutterstock_251398867-300x227.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/shutterstock_251398867-362x274.jpg 362w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Focusing on the perfect pose. <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no such thing as a perfect pose. Focus instead on bettering yourself every time you\u2019re on the mat, and the fat burning will happen naturally from your own personal challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Forgetting to diet. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While yoga is an amazing fat loss resource, you cannot continue to eat junk and expect to lose weight. Don\u2019t neglect your diet when losing weight just because you\u2019ve picked up a calm yoga practice!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Not practicing often enough. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do yoga at least 3 times a week for optimal fat burning. Anything less and you will not be able to lose much weight. <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/make-yoga-a-healthy-habit\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Make yoga a habit!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Not tracking your progress. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep a journal, and take notes on your weight, measurements, and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-poses-you-should-do-every-day\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">progress with different poses.<\/a> The mirror will play tricks, but your journal will let you know if you\u2019re on the right track!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>10. Not having a step-by-step plan to help you through the process. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest problem most people face when losing weight with yoga is not having a step-by-step plan to help you progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you are looking for some additional tips and an actual workout plan, our&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Yoga Fat Loss Bible for Beginners<\/a><\/span>&nbsp;is a great place to start.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with&nbsp;everything you need to get started, including&nbsp;a <strong>complete 12-week workout plan, a flexibility guide, and a beginner&#8217;s guide to meditation!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>It also now comes with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">complete video workouts!<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1817\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/yoga-fat-loss-bible-video-bundle-by-avocadu-min.png\" alt=\"Yoga Fat Loss Bible by Avocadu\" class=\"wp-image-25829\" title=\"Yoga Fat Loss Bible by Avocadu\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/yoga-fat-loss-bible-video-bundle-by-avocadu-min.png 1817w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/yoga-fat-loss-bible-video-bundle-by-avocadu-min-300x88.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/yoga-fat-loss-bible-video-bundle-by-avocadu-min-768x224.png 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/yoga-fat-loss-bible-video-bundle-by-avocadu-min-1024x299.png 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/yoga-fat-loss-bible-video-bundle-by-avocadu-min-365x106.png 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/yoga-fat-loss-bible-video-bundle-by-avocadu-min-355x104.png 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1817px) 100vw, 1817px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a&nbsp;great solution around for those looking to <strong>lose weight, get more flexible, and relieve aches and pains<\/strong> with a calm yoga practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will show you exactly how to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">melt away stubborn body fat<\/a><\/strong><\/span> with a regular yoga practice and has the top 50 fat-burning yoga poses every beginner should learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">You can check it out by <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>clicking here.<\/strong><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Always remember that the&nbsp;most difficult part of doing yoga getting yourself on the mat!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Leave a comment below if you enjoyed this article or have any questions!<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You&#8217;ve heard that yoga is great for helping you lose weight but are you making one or more of these mistakes along the way?
