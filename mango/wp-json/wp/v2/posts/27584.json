Not only is it a bummer emotionally, but stress can cause some serious physical health issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/weird-signs-youre-stressed-out_us_59721fd8e4b00e4363df16f5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stress<\/a><\/span> is <em>everywhere. <\/em>We feel it at work, in the car, at home, online; every place we go, there it is. If this sounds like you, maybe it\u2019s time to hit the mat and start a yoga practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yoga will help you chill out, and there\u2019s loads of science to back that claim up.<\/strong> Studies show that it changes your brain by helping it make a neurotransmitter called <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/how-yoga-changes-your-brain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GABA<\/a><\/span> that will give you all the feels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GABA calms you down in a way that\u2019s similar to alcohol, without all the nasty side-effects. Scientists believe that the combination of breath, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/20-minute-morning-yoga-stretch-for-beginners\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">stretching<\/span><\/a>, and meditation in a yoga practice are what causes you to release more GABA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all yoga poses promote relaxation, though. They\u2019re all going to contribute to your well-being, but certain poses do different things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do poses that are going to help with strength, balance, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-poses-for-flexibility\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">flexibility<\/span><\/a>, and even to give you extra energy. There are also many that are designed specifically to help you decompress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Child\u2019s Pose (Mudhasana)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/childs-basic-yoga-pose-for-beginners.jpg\" alt=\"child's basic yoga pose for beginners\" class=\"wp-image-5546\" title=\"child's basic yoga pose for beginners\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/childs-basic-yoga-pose-for-beginners.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/childs-basic-yoga-pose-for-beginners-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/childs-basic-yoga-pose-for-beginners-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>After an intense yoga practice, sinking into <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.doyou.com\/how-to-do-childs-pose\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Child\u2019s Pose<\/a><\/span> feels like heaven. It\u2019s an incredibly nourishing pose that has so many yummy benefits, including how comforting and relaxing it is to hold it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s great for digestion because it massages the belly as you breathe in and out. It also <strong>opens the hips and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-back-pain-relief-best-poses\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stretches the lower back.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s one of the primary resting poses used in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yogajournal.com\/yoga-101\/types-of-yoga\/hatha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Hatha yoga<\/span><\/a> because it gives you a moment to take a break and recharge your batteries. Child\u2019s Pose is a lovely reminder to relax and just breathe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s how you do it:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Sit back on your heels from a kneeling position, with the knees close together. If this is uncomfortable for you, it\u2019s perfectly fine to spread the knees apart. Do what\u2019s comfortable for you.<\/li><li>As you lengthen through the spine, take a nice, deep breath in.<\/li><li>Exhale as you move your arms in front of you and bend down toward the floor, eventually resting your forehead and chest on your thighs.<\/li><li>You can also place your arms by your sides, palms resting by the feet and facing upward.<\/li><li>Hold the pose for as long as you\u2019d like.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Legs Up the Wall Pose (Viparita Karani)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This passive, supported pose is another great one for calming the mind. It\u2019s also a super approachable pose that\u2019s <strong>easy for beginners.<\/strong> No pretzel twists here!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.yogajournal.com\/poses\/legs-up-the-wall-pose\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Legs Up the Wall Pose<\/a><\/span> stretches out the back of the legs and gives tired feet a lovely rest. It\u2019s also <strong>great for draining excess fluid and increasing circulation<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps negate the stagnant effects of sitting in a chair all day long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s how you do it:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Find a wall where you can make a cozy space with your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/5-best-yoga-mats-beginner-yogis\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">yoga mat<\/span><\/a> or a blanket, then lie down and shimmy your hips as close to the wall as possible.<\/li><li>Walk your feet up the wall until you\u2019re in an L-shaped position. Your tushy doesn\u2019t need to be right against the wall. If you find that your legs are too tight to have them straight, then move your body away from the wall until you\u2019re comfortable.<\/li><li>You can put a folded towel or small pillow under your sacrum for comfort and to help with circulation.<\/li><li>Place your arms at your sides or gently rest your hands on the belly, and breathe.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. <\/strong>Supine<strong> Spinal Twist Pose (Supta Jathara Parivartanasana)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"334\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/half-spinal-twist-basic-yoga-pose-for-beginners.jpg\" alt=\"half spinal twist basic yoga pose for beginners\" class=\"wp-image-5548\" title=\"half spinal twist basic yoga pose for beginners\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/half-spinal-twist-basic-yoga-pose-for-beginners.jpg 334w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/half-spinal-twist-basic-yoga-pose-for-beginners-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/half-spinal-twist-basic-yoga-pose-for-beginners-183x274.jpg 183w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>When we get stressed, most of us hunch our shoulders like Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. <strong>It\u2019s a natural reflex to want to protect our heart space when bad things happen<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of spinal twist poses in yoga, but the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pocketyoga.com\/Pose\/supine_spinal_twist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Supine Spinal Twist<\/a><\/span> is the most relaxing of the bunch. It\u2019s easier to chillax when you\u2019re lying down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This pose is going to open up your shoulders and chest while elongating the back muscles. It can also help with digestion because of the \u201cwringing\u201d motion of the pose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s how you do it:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Lie down flat on your back on the floor.<\/li><li>Bend your right knee up and lift it toward your chest to about hip height, while keeping the left leg relatively straight.<\/li><li>Cross your bent knee over to the left side as far as you can comfortably go while keeping both shoulders rooted to the floor. Use your left hand to put gentle pressure on your knee.<\/li><li><strong>This can be a difficult pose for some people, as the chest, abdomen, and front shoulder muscles can be extremely tight<\/strong>! We\u2019re always hunched over keyboards or our phones nowadays. It\u2019s important to take a few moments to focus on the breath in this pose.<\/li><li>Repeat on the other side.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.
