Detoxing can have dramatic effects on your overall health and how you feel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.

Detox programs can help to get some of it back. One of the best benefits from detoxification of the body is increased energy levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong> Cutting out harmful chemicals like sugars, hydrogenated oils, fatty foods, and dangerous energy drinks&nbsp;while&nbsp;replacing them with water, vegetables, and fresh fruits, can cause a&nbsp;dramatic spike in the body&#8217;s natural energy levels.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things you&nbsp;will notice in your&nbsp;day-to-day life:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Wake up and feel energized to start the&nbsp;day<\/li><li>Experience less&nbsp;midday energy crashes<\/li><li>Have a greater desire for new experiences instead of time on the couch<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Improves mental clarity<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a direct connection between cognitive and digestive health. &nbsp;Once you improve your overall health, you will notice the&nbsp;mind becoming clearer. &nbsp;Foods labeled as inflammatory&nbsp;not only affect your&nbsp;organs and gut but the&nbsp;brain as well. &nbsp;Most people overlook the&nbsp;important fact that&nbsp;inflammation from foods happens in the brain as well as the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Once you clear your plate of sugar and fatty foods, you will notice clearer thinking and an improved mood as a result of the detoxification process. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things you will notice in your day to day life:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Less brain fog, especially midday<\/li><li>Better focus and attention to detail on daily tasks<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

Aids in weight loss<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how cutting out sugar and fatty foods from the&nbsp;diet will impact weight quickly. Toxins affect the body&#8217;s natural ability to burn fat and lead to weight gain. When&nbsp;foods are not digesting properly, losing weight will be more difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things you will notice in your day to day life:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Yoga pants&nbsp;will fit better<\/li><li>Detox programs can make the weight on the scale drop fast<\/li><li>Gradual, steady weight loss over time<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5.

Free radicals are incomplete electrons that are devastating to your health and aging processes, but when you eats more vegetables and fresh fruits, they will combat these free radicals with powerful antioxidants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The antioxidants will keep the body&nbsp;looking younger and healthier while slowing the aging process.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things you will notice in your day to day life:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fewer wrinkles on your forehead and around the eyes<\/li><li>Fewer bags under the&nbsp;eyes when you wake up<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Clearer skin<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Environmental and diet-based toxins can have very visible results on the largest organ in the body &#8211; the skin. Detoxifying the body can help with acne, strengthen nails and hair, and will help provide a natural, healthy glow. As toxins leave the body through the skin, a slight increase in acne or even patchiness to the skin is common.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t worry though, it will clear up after a few days, and when it does, you will be left with healthy, vibrant skin that you will love.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things you will notice in your day to day life:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Improved skin color and overall complexion<\/li><li>Nails and hair will grow a little faster than normal<\/li><li>Acne will become a rare occurrence, if ever<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Helps curb sugar and carb cravings<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a fact that sugar and carbohydrates are biologically addictive. Sugar has even been reported&nbsp;to be 8 times more addictive than cocaine. There&#8217;s a reason why it&#8217;s so hard to give it up, and thankfully a sugar detox<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&nbsp;<\/span>can help with this. There really is no better way to kick these craving than to cut it out for a while. The problem is that this can induce headaches and sluggish feelings that come with withdrawal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That is why replacing the sugars and bad carbs with healthy detox recipes is so important.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things you will notice in your day to day life:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cravings for fruits and vegetables<\/li><li>Bad&nbsp;feelings if you consume sugars and bad carbs again<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Improves digestive health<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When detoxing, the body is&nbsp;getting rid of the excess waste stored in the gut and fat cells. The primary way this happens is through the increase in fiber that comes with detoxing. The fiber helps cleanse the colon and drag out any of the toxins that get built up over time. It also&nbsp;improves the functionality of the liver and kidneys that are responsible for processing the foods that you eat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In this way, the body will be able to better absorb the vitamins and nutrients from your food.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things you will notice in your day to day life:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Becoming regular<\/li><li>More instant energy from&nbsp;food<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9.
