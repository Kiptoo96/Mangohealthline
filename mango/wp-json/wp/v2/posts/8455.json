You get it, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well did you also know that it can be a powerful weight loss tool when used properly?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I am&nbsp;going to talk about using green tea to lose weight and how to make the best cup of green tea for weight loss possible.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll also&nbsp;talk about a relatively <strong>new kind of green tea that\u2019s 3x as effective as regular green tea<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the science of how green tea helps you lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. You\u2019ll burn more fat during exercise.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been quite a few studies showing green tea as a great <strong>fat burner for workouts<\/strong>. &nbsp;In one particular study, participants burned 17% more fat than those taking a placebo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinking green tea or coffee 30 minutes before a workout is ideal for fat-burning potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Green tea contains EGCG and tons of antioxidants.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"468\" height=\"312\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/green-tea.jpg\" alt=\"green tea\" class=\"wp-image-28559\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/green-tea.jpg 468w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/green-tea-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/green-tea-365x243.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/green-tea-355x237.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Where green tea really stands out from other drinks is with&nbsp;its high level of antioxidants and catechins. &nbsp;Specifically, one known as <strong>EGCG<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This substance has been shown to<strong> improve calories burned<\/strong> during the day and to be&nbsp;excellent for overall health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Green tea mobilizes fat by improving hormonal levels.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>EGCG has also been shown to increase levels of <strong>norepinephrine<\/strong>. &nbsp;This hormone is used to signal fat cells and tell them that it\u2019s time to be broken down and used as energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process helps to <strong>mobilize fat faster off the body<\/strong> and <strong>retain more lean muscle tissue<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Green tea helps you lose dangerous visceral fat.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Visceral fat, also commonly recognized as abdominal fat, is very dangerous and highly correlated with different diseases and even early death.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green tea has been not only shown to help people lose weight, but also to <strong>lose a little bit more of it around the stomach region<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Green tea gives a metabolic boost both short and long-term.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of EGCG and caffeine seems to have both <strong>short-term and long-term metabolic effects<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one study of 60 obese individuals, the group taking green tea extract lost 7.3 lbs more pounds and burned 183 more calories per day after 3 months (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18006026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">17<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also some other non-weight loss benefits of green tea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>It lowers the risk of certain diseases.<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>It lowers the risk of certain cancers. <\/strong>For instance, women who drink green tea are 22% less likely to develop breast cancer.<\/li><li><strong>It may help you live longer. <\/strong>It\u2019s usually a regularly consumed drink by the world&#8217;s longest living sub groups of people.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three main ways to consume green tea to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Green&nbsp;Tea Extract<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just the herbal derivative from green tea leaves. &nbsp;The positives of this method seem to be that you get around <strong>25%-50% more antioxidants<\/strong> from the extraction process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, green tea extract commonly comes in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B013XKP3TG\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=avocadu-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B013XKP3TG&amp;linkId=04be8fc98da475452120c53b308dae25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">pill form.<\/a> &nbsp;So if you don\u2019t like the taste of green tea or are on the go, it can be a more convenient option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand below is our favorite and can be found on Amazon. &nbsp;It&#8217;s FDA-approved, manufactured in the USA, made with non-GMO ingredients, and is third-party tested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a

are consumed as a liquid vs. a pill\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Regular Green Tea Steeped in Cup<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is, of course, the kind of green tea bags that you can find in any grocery&nbsp;store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make, bring water to a hot temperature (just under boiling) with a microwave or tea kettle,&nbsp;and add in a packet of green tea. &nbsp;Let it sit for 1-3 minutes, stir and enjoy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The positives of this method are that it\u2019s easy to drink AND adds to your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/drinking-water-lose-weight\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">daily water intake.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawbacks are that it takes a little longer to make than taking a pill, which makes people tend to forget about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp;recommend having it first thing in the morning or after dinner in the evenings. &nbsp;The point is to have it at the same time every day to make it a habit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Matcha Green Tea<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is by far the BEST option! &nbsp;Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because matcha tea is made through a special shading process in Japan that gives&nbsp;it <strong>3x the amount of EGCG and antioxidants as regular green tea<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow! &nbsp;It also has a really cool bright green color to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only drawbacks are that it is a little more expensive and time-consuming to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it does not come in a packet, you have to whisk the tea yourself.&nbsp; With the right tools though, it\u2019s not&nbsp;bad at all. &nbsp;The benefits far outweigh the drawbacks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to get the best value from your matcha, the&nbsp;brand below will give you the best bang for your buck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a
