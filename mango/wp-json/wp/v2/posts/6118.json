Belly fat is s<u>tubborn.<\/u><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When people talk about having \u201cstubborn body fat,\u201d they are 99% of the time referring to their stomach and love handles. &nbsp;This is because belly fat is usually the first place people put on weight and the last place they lose it from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is maddening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially when you\u2019re dieting and exercising like you\u2019re \u201csupposed to,\u201d but the stomach will not budge. &nbsp;It is truly the hardest place to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Problem #2. Belly fat is dangerous.<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty much every deadly disease known to man is linked to having a large waist circumference. Here\u2019s the shortlist of things excess stomach fat has been associated with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Death: Over 300,000 obesity-related deaths happen every year.<\/li><li>Heart Disease and Stroke<\/li><li>Diabetes<\/li><li>High Blood Pressure<\/li><li>Cancer<\/li><li>Gallbladder disease and gallstones<\/li><li>Gout<\/li><li>Osteoarthritis<\/li><li>Breathing problems such as sleep apnea, asthma, and others<\/li><li>Joint pains<\/li><li>And much more<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Stomach fat or visceral fat should be much more of a concern than fat found in other areas of the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the physical appeal of having great abs, it also greatly improves your overall health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Problem #3. People trying to lose belly fat usually do it WRONG. <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The real problem that most people face when trying to lose stubborn, unwanted fat is that they focus on the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">wrong things.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s exactly what that means in a simple equation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diet &gt; Exercise<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure exercise is important, but in the world of health and fitness, diet is 80% of your results and exercise will account for around 20%. &nbsp;It\u2019s an important 20%, but people need to understand this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone is eating a ton of twinkies at lunch and then doing a few crunches at home in the evening, they should not expect Gisele Bundchen abs anytime soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the facts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Exercising the ability to walk away from the kitchen!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make no mistake; this is the #1 most effective of the exercises to lose belly fat. &nbsp;I wanted to make sure to cover this again in case you just skipped down to the exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>80% Diet. 20% Exercise.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t forget it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, here are the best 8 exercises to lose belly fat and for developing abdominal muscles once you have the right diet in place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.
