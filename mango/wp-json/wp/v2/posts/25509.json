It began to be produced commercially in 1970.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1988, NASA published a report proposing that spirulina could be grown in space and used in the astronauts\u2019 diet (<a href=\"https:\/\/ntrs.nasa.gov\/archive\/nasa\/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov\/19890016190.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1<\/a>). Today, you can buy it in <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2j8h2h6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">powder<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2iGKKX0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">pill form<\/a> from just about any health food retailer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would you consume spirulina?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a quick and easy way to take in the following nutrients (<a href=\"https:\/\/ndb.nal.usda.gov\/ndb\/foods\/show\/3306?fgcd=&amp;manu=&amp;lfacet=&amp;format=&amp;count=&amp;max=50&amp;offset=&amp;sort=default&amp;order=asc&amp;qlookup=spirulina&amp;ds=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2<\/a>):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Protein<\/li><li>Thiamin<\/li><li>Riboflavin<\/li><li>Niacin<\/li><li>Copper<\/li><li>Iron<\/li><li>Magnesium<\/li><li>Potassium<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And has all of these health benefits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Spirulina can help you lose weight.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not a magical weight loss pill, but spirulina can help you <strong>maintain healthy weight loss.<\/strong> It\u2019s packed with <strong>nutrients<\/strong> and contains <strong>4&nbsp;grams of protein and fiber in just one 20-calorie tablespoon.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your body is getting the nutrition it needs, it\u2019s less likely to send you signals that make you binge on foods that give you a quick pick-me-up, like sugar. The high protein can help you build muscle and stay full for longer after you eat it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research also shows that spirulina can help <strong>control blood sugar<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23121873\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3<\/a>). Evidence shows that the seaweed helps <strong>reverse insulin resistance<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23368938\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">4<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your<strong> weight issues are linked to insulin resistance,<\/strong> this benefit can help you lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Spirulina improves brain function.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we can\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll gain IQ points, you can <strong>prevent memory loss<\/strong> from oxidative stress to brain cells if you consume spirulina (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21697639\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">5<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research also shows that taking just two grams a day can <strong>improve academic performance.<\/strong> Consuming spirulina can also make you <strong>more productive and focused<\/strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19863020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">6<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20228219\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">7<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially important as you age. Scientists have found that taking spirulina can <strong>reduce your risk of developing degenerative brain disorders,<\/strong> like Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18572379\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">8<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Spirulina is anti-inflammatory.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spirulina-powder-superfood-benefits.jpg\" alt=\"spirulina powder superfood benefits\" class=\"wp-image-25517\" title=\"spirulina powder superfood benefits\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spirulina-powder-superfood-benefits.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spirulina-powder-superfood-benefits-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spirulina-powder-superfood-benefits-365x244.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spirulina-powder-superfood-benefits-355x237.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some laboratory studies show that spirulina is just as effective as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in <strong>reducing inflammation<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s000110050256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">9<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phycocyanin, one of the compounds that gives spirulina its bright blue-green color, can impede the production of molecules that signal inflammation. It has been found to <strong>reduce swelling and histamine release in inflamed tissues.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spirulina may help <strong>treat <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/unhealthy-gut-warning-signs\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">leaky gut<\/a> and inflammatory bowel disease.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Spirulina can help with your allergies.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you experience allergies or hay fever, your immune system is responding to particles in the environment by making you sneezy and itchy. You may become congested and sniffly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spirulina is often used as an <strong>herbal remedy for seasonal allergies,<\/strong> and with good reason (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24324897\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">10<\/a>). Evidence shows that spirulina can <strong>minimize allergy symptoms<\/strong> without causing side effects (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18343939\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">11<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Spirulina can boost your immunity.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/034194_spirulina_superfood.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Natural News<\/a>, spirulina encourages your body to p<strong>roduce more red and white blood cells.<\/strong> This can help you <strong>fight viruses and bacteria<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11962722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">12<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Spirulina can fight cancer.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you see a statement that a supplement fights cancer, it seems too good to be true. However, evidence really does suggest that spirulina\u2019s <strong>high levels of <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/anti-aging-foods-healthy-skin\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">antioxidants<\/a><\/strong> can help <strong>kill cancer cells<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2695150\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">13<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is especially effective in <strong>shrinking precancerous lesions in the mouth<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8584455\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">14<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn\u2019t make spirulina a miracle cure for cancer. However, it does suggest that adding it to a healthy diet can help <strong>keep your cells and DNA healthy,<\/strong> possibly <strong>reducing your risk of cancer.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Spirulina is good for your liver.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re not a heavy drinker or don\u2019t have liver disease, you might overlook this one. However, keeping your liver healthy can help with <strong>digestion, weight management, and nutrient absorption.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of those things impact your health. Your liver is responsible for <strong>managing cholesterol and secretes enzymes to aid in digestion.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your liver isn\u2019t working properly, so much of your digestion and health suffers too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Spirulina Recipes<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So how can you take spirulina? Sure, you can take it in <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2iGKKX0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">pill form<\/a>, but it can be tough to remember to swallow a pill every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, it\u2019s more fun to turn it into a tasty recipe, and cooking with <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2j8h2h6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">spirulina powder<\/a> is a good way to sneak it into the kids\u2019 food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 5 ways to get your spirulina in throughout the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Green Spirulina Smoothie<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spirulina-superfood-benefits-for-recipes.jpg\" alt=\"spirulina superfood benefits for recipes\" class=\"wp-image-25518\" title=\"spirulina superfood benefits for recipes\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spirulina-superfood-benefits-for-recipes.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spirulina-superfood-benefits-for-recipes-300x204.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spirulina-superfood-benefits-for-recipes-365x248.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/spirulina-superfood-benefits-for-recipes-355x241.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don\u2019t like the taste of spirulina. Adding it to a smoothie <strong>masks the flavor,<\/strong> so all you get is a vivid color and health-boosting effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make a green spirulina smoothie, blend a handful of spinach with a cup of pineapple, half a cucumber, ice, and kombucha or water. Add in a tablespoon or two of powdered spirulina.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong> Green Spirulina Wrap<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes a <strong>great snack or lunch.<\/strong> It\u2019s light, delicious and packed with nutrients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grab a few of the largest collard leaves you can find. Cut off the part of the stem that sticks out the bottom, and blanch them in boiling water for 5 seconds (that\u2019s right, only 5 seconds).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mash up an avocado with a tablespoon of powdered spirulina, lime juice, a sprinkle of cumin, a sprinkle of sea salt and a sprinkle of paprika. Spread it on an open collard leaf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add some shredded carrot, finely chopped cucumber and 1 tablespoon of hemp seeds and roll up like a burrito.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong> Mint \u201cIce Cream\u201d<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you love mint chocolate chip ice cream but don\u2019t love green food coloring, try making it with spirulina instead. This recipe is <strong>dairy free.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soak 2 cups of raw, unsalted cashews in water overnight. Drain and add to a high-powered blender with a handful of fresh mint leaves (or 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract), \u00bc cup maple syrup, \u00bc cup water, 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and \u00bc teaspoon of spirulina.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blend it until smooth, then place in the freezer in a covered container. Stir it every hour until it freezes up and resembles ice cream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optional: add&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2igORrT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">cacao nibs<\/a> before you freeze it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong> Spirulina Energy Balls<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In a high-powered blender, pulse \u00bc cup of cashews with \u00bc cup of rolled oats until it looks like a coarse flour. Add 2 chopped dates, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1 tablespoon shredded coconut and \u00bc teaspoon of spirulina powder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blend until it looks like a sticky dough. Remove it from the blender and roll it into balls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roll the balls in sesame seeds, if desired, and store in the fridge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong> Spirulina Peanut Butter Fudge<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Melt together 1\/3 cup coconut oil, 1\/3 cup raw <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2idFgHd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">cacao powder<\/a>, 1 tablespoon spirulina powder and 1\/3 cup of honey or maple syrup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pour into a parchment-lined baking sheet, bowl or dish. It should be small enough that the mixture fills it to about \u00bd-inch thick. Swirl in 1\/3 cup of melted peanut butter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Place in the refrigerator for several hours, until it hardens. Cut into pieces with a knife.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This must be eaten cold, or it will melt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where Can I Get Spirulina?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I buy it off Amazon because that is what is the most convenient for me. &nbsp;You can also find it at health food stores, although Amazon is usually a little bit cheaper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for it in powder form, we use and recommend <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2j8h2h6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Healthworks<\/a>. &nbsp;It&#8217;s organic and a great price!
