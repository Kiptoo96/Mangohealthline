Not only is it uncomfortable, but it can make your tummy look like you\u2019ve swallowed a balloon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Want to get rid of it forever?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are loads of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/bloated-stomach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reasons<\/a> why your belly might be bloating. Here are a few:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Poor diet<\/li><li>Food sensitivities<\/li><li>Dehydration<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/how-hormones-affect-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Hormones<\/strong><\/a><\/li><li>Bacterial overgrowth<\/li><li>Yeast<\/li><li>Too little fiber<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloating can also be caused by more serious health problems like a bowel obstruction, infection, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.naturopathic.org\/article_content.asp?article=784\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gastrointestinal disorders<\/a> like IBS, <strong>colitis,<\/strong> celiac disease, or even cancer, but in most cases, it\u2019s <strong>because of how your body digests what you put into it<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what can you do about it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cut Out the Carbs<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you love sugary sodas, pasta, and bread, then I have bad news for you; if you want a nice flat tummy and a gas-free existence, <em>you\u2019re going to have to give up a few things.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sugar ferments in the gut<\/strong>, which causes <strong>inflammation and<\/strong> <strong>candida<\/strong> <strong>overgrowth<\/strong>, which contributes to that bloated feeling you get after you\u2019ve had a carb overload. This can cause your poop to become trapped in the digestive system and when air flows around it\u2026well, you know the rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also lots of vegetables that are loaded with carbs which make them difficult to digest, like soybeans, cauliflower, mushrooms, garlic, and onions. A <strong>good rule of thumb<\/strong> when figuring out what carbs you can eat to help ease bloating is following an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibsdiets.org\/fodmap-diet\/fodmap-food-list\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IBS<\/a> diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So why would carbs from vegetables give you so much trouble?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Carbs are a&nbsp;raw material that our body uses to make energy.<\/strong> There are two kinds of carbs; simple and complex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Simple carbs<\/strong><\/em> break down really fast into sugar, while <em><strong>complex carbs<\/strong><\/em> like to take their time. This is why you get a \u201csugar high\u201d after eating candy or drinking an energy drink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The carbs in some vegetables are complex, and many of us have difficulty digesting them because we don\u2019t make the enzyme we need to break them down properly in the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you love broccoli or spinach and can\u2019t live without it, then take a <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2f13UKM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">digestive enzyme<\/a> before you eat it. It can help the stomach break down the carbs for digestion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also make a smoothie or juice vegetables that are difficult to digest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Processed food can also have added sugar<\/strong>. They try to trick you with names like sucrose, fructose, dextrose, and maltose, but it\u2019s all still going to give you a bloated belly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial sweeteners are even worse, so <strong>avoid them like the plague<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Watch What You Drink<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What you drink can cause just as much bloating as what you eat.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/sugar-drink-soda.jpg\" alt=\"eliminating sugary drinks from the diet can reduce belly bloat\" class=\"wp-image-8103\" title=\"eliminating sugary drinks from the diet can reduce belly bloat\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/sugar-drink-soda.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/sugar-drink-soda-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/sugar-drink-soda-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sodas, sparkling water, and other <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livestrong.com\/article\/500187-digestion-of-carbonated-beverages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fizzy drinks<\/a> introduce carbon dioxide into the stomach, which makes you burp. If there is too much of it in the stomach, it sends it down to the digestive system and becomes gas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is beer carbonated, but it\u2019s alcohol, which can also cause a bloated belly<strong>. Alcohol slows the digestive process<\/strong> and causes dehydration, which makes you retain water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also messes with the good bacteria in your gut and causes damage to the digestive tract.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you really need to get your drink on, at least keep yourself hydrated. Have a glass of water in between cocktails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also be drinking a lot of water in general because it<strong> helps you digest food and can reduce the effects of carb-induced bloating. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hold the Cheese, Please<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, I know. Cheese is incredibly delicious. I won&#8217;t deny it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also loaded with calcium and other good stuff, but <a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/symptoms-of-lactose-intolerance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lactose intolerance<\/a> is a real thing and is more widespread now than it used to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lactose is a naturally occurring sugar found in dairy foods like yogurt, milk, and cheese<\/strong>. If you have belly bloat, it might be because you are lactose sensitive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The digestive system doesn\u2019t absorb lactose properly in people who are sensitive, so it becomes fermented by bacteria.&nbsp; The result is belly bloat and gas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try eliminating dairy for a few days and see if your belly bloat goes away. <strong>It\u2019s a common cause<\/strong> and one that\u2019s easy to fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can replace creamer or milk with almond milk, but beware; it often has a thickening agent called <strong><em>carrageenan<\/em><\/strong>, which is made from seaweed that can cause <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/fix-leaky-gut-heal-autoimmune-problems\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inflammation in the gut.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Add Good Bacteria to Your Belly<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/probiotics-prebiotics-lose-weight-naturally\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Probiotics<\/a> are friendly bacteria that will kill the bad gut bugs that cause all the belly trouble.
