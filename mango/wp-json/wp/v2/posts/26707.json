go hand in hand, we first need to understand the disease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Office on Women\u2019s Health, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, PCOS occurs when <strong>your body has an imbalance of reproductive hormones that create problems in your ovaries (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.womenshealth.gov\/publications\/our-publications\/fact-sheet\/polycystic-ovary-syndrome.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>).<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The condition may cause your egg not to release monthly like normal, and you may miss your period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While an occasional missed period isn\u2019t cause for alarm, if it happens regularly, you may have issues with fertility and develop cysts on your ovaries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Do I Know if I Have PCOS?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PCOS is <em>most common in women of childbearing age<\/em> (defined as between the ages of 15 and 44), and one clinical study says that one in 15 women will develop the disease (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17304034\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The risk of developing it is higher if you\u2019re obese, or have a female family member who also has PCOS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Common symptoms of PCOS are:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Irregular menstrual cycle<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Too much hair on parts of the body women typically don&#8217;t have any, like the face, chin, or neck<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Acne breakouts on the face, chest, and upper back<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hair loss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight gain or difficulty losing weight<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Skin darkening in areas where the skin creases, like the groin, underneath the breasts, or along your neckline.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Skin tags on the armpits or neck<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why is it Difficult to Lose Weight With PCOS?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the exact cause of PCOS is unknown, experts at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/pcos\/basics\/causes\/con-20028841\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mayo Clinic<\/a> believe that the<strong> excess production of male sex hormones,<\/strong> androgens, play a part.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although women should produce some of these hormones, <strong>having too many in the system will prevent ovulation.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another contributing factor to PCOS is <strong><em>high insulin levels<\/em>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img

resistant, your body can\u2019t convert sugars and starches from the food you eat into energy efficiently, and you\u2019ll have high levels of insulin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>High insulin levels are known to trigger the production of androgens.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the American Diabetes Association, the insulin resistance found in women with PCOS can also contribute to developing diabetes (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.diabetes.org\/living-with-diabetes\/treatment-and-care\/women\/polycystic-ovarian-syndrome.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, <strong>losing weight with the disease follows a lot of the same practices as shedding pounds when you have diabetes, and there are lots of ways to do it successfully.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Lifestyle Changes to Help Lose Weight with PCOS<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Making several <a

evidence-backed suggestions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Exercise Daily<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.obesityaction.org\/educational-resources\/resource-articles-2\/obesity-related-diseases\/polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-and-obesity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Obesity Action Coalition<\/a>, exercising daily can help improve how your body uses insulin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try adding 30 minutes of movement into your everyday routine like <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/walking-to-lose-weight\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">walking<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/top-5-yoga-poses-for-beginners\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yoga<\/a>, using the elliptical, or taking a class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer to workout at home, try this 30-minute low impact workout courtesy of Pop Sugar Fitness that has lots of beginner-friendly moves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/17DxIBjMygE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, beginners don\u2019t need to work so hard that you \u201cfeel the burn\u201d or are sore the next day.&nbsp; Any daily moment will start you on the path to improving your health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Make Nutritional Changes<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Managing your insulin levels is one key to shedding pounds.&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because PCOS not only makes it difficult for your body to process sugar, but it also messes with some of the hormones that regulate your appetite, it can be challenging not to overeat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that you eat <strong>lots of high-fiber and nutritionally dense foods like vegetables and lean proteins. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you eat carbohydrates, make sure to<strong> stick to complex carbs <\/strong>like sweet potatoes, brown rice, and rolled oats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay away from processed choices that have lots of sugar and added fat and will have an adverse impact on your insulin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a plan to tell you how exactly to do this and what exactly to eat every day, you can read more about <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a> at the bottom of this article!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Minimize Distractions When You Eat<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a study by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, they found that people who multitask while they eat a meal tend to eat more in that sitting than they would if they weren\u2019t distracted (<a href=\"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2013\/02\/25\/ajcn.112.045245.abstract?sid=68f5e210-d7ea-4eb5-a322-c25e3c6b4a20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, life is busy.&nbsp; Yes, it\u2019s challenging to carve out a lunch break or sit down to eat <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/healthy-go-to-breakfast-recipes\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">breakfast<\/a> in the morning.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/eat-healthy-breakfast-to-lose-weight.jpg\" alt=\"eat healthy breakfast to lose weight with PCOS\" class=\"wp-image-26782\" title=\"eat healthy breakfast to lose weight with PCOS\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/eat-healthy-breakfast-to-lose-weight.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/eat-healthy-breakfast-to-lose-weight-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/eat-healthy-breakfast-to-lose-weight-365x244.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/eat-healthy-breakfast-to-lose-weight-355x237.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But, making the time to consciously focus on your food when you\u2019re eating it will help you feel more satisfied, and make it easy to cut calories and lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Sleep 8 Hours Every Night<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a clinical study published in Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America, sleep deprivation has a direct link to developing insulin resistance (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3767932\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this particular study looked at diabetics, we know that insulin plays a significant role in the weight loss problems that people with PCOS have as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A lack of sleep has both a direct effect on the hormones that regulate hunger levels, and insulin, so it\u2019s important to make time to get a solid eight hours.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to bed a bit earlier each night, and try turning off your tv and other electronics 30-minutes before you want to fall asleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making time to sleep is just as important as making time to exercise or eat well when it comes to losing weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"> <strong>5. Eat at Home <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take the time to cook and eat your meals at home, and you\u2019ll not only eat better, but you&#8217;ll also eat less.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the American Cancer Society, people who eat out at restaurants eat around 200 calories more than they would if they ate a home-cooked meal (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.org\/latest-news\/adults-take-in-about-200-extra-calories-per-day-when-they-eat-out.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the food that people eat at a restaurant is less nutritious than what we eat at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When researchers did the math, the results were shocking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you eat out twice weekly, which was the average in the study, you\u2019ll consume an additional 20,000 calories per year or about six pounds!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, search for <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/category\/recipes\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recipes<\/a> that are similar to some of your favorite restaurant dishes, but cook them at home so you can keep a close eye on the fat, starch, and sugar content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Remember that your health and your happiness are the greatest assets you have.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are ready to make a change in your diet and lifestyle, our <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a> is a great place to start!
