You\u2019ve shared your race entry on your socials and have set out on a brand new pair of running shoes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This is going to be amazing.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are countless articles out there about <a href=\"https:\/\/marathonhandbook.com\/half-marathon-training\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">how to train for a half marathon<\/a>.

It\u2019s one of the most common mistakes that rookie half marathon runners make.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The starting pistol fires and you head out, feeling like you\u2019re running on air.
