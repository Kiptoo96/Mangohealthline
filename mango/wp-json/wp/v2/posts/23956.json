It\u2019s important to m<strong>ake your yoga routine a healthy habit.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding anything new to your life can be a struggle. S<em>ome days, it feels like you don\u2019t have time for anything extra.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you make your yoga routine a healthy habit? Research shows that <strong>creating a habit is more complex than simply performing an activity frequently<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1469029207000039\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a habit involves being <strong>empowered to make decisions.<\/strong> It involves <strong>setting intentions and repeating activities to automate them.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll give you some tips for making your yoga practice a consistent habit so that it becomes as routine as brushing your teeth!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Set strong intentions.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can set a goal, but if you don\u2019t set an intention for the way that you\u2019re going to implement that goal, researchers say that you\u2019re less likely to achieve it (<a href=\"http:\/\/psp.sagepub.com\/content\/31\/1\/87.short\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>). Also, experts say that <strong>if the intentions aren\u2019t strong, you\u2019re less likely to follow through.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s the reason that you want to implement a yoga habit? It doesn\u2019t matter what the answer is as long as it\u2019s a reason that\u2019s <strong>important to<em> you<\/em>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some great examples of yoga goals include <em>increased flexibility, arm strength, meditation, reduced stress, and back pain relief among many others.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Do it every day.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/woman-stretching-on-mat-2.jpg\" alt=\"woman doing yoga stretch on blue yoga mat\" class=\"wp-image-7537\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/woman-stretching-on-mat-2.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/woman-stretching-on-mat-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/woman-stretching-on-mat-2-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Research shows that <strong>it\u2019s easier to develop a habit if it is <em>consistent<\/em>.<\/strong> If you have a complicated schedule that involves doing yoga on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Saturdays, you\u2019re less likely to stick to it than if the schedule involves practicing every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to research, <strong>missing one opportunity isn\u2019t going to derail you from forming a habit.<\/strong> However, <strong>the more days that you miss, the less likely you are to automate the habit<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com.sci-hub.cc\/doi\/10.1002\/ejsp.674\/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tie this one back into #1. &nbsp;For example, I have two main goals that I am aiming for with my yoga practice: Splits and Handstands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to be able to do both of these, and to do them, <strong>I have to work at them&nbsp;every day!<\/strong> &nbsp;Your muscles become more flexible over time with practice, but they will go right back to square one if you don&#8217;t practice often enough!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Make it easy.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are going to practice every day, <strong>make it easy.<\/strong> Telling yourself that you\u2019re going to do an hour of yoga a day isn\u2019t always feasible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finding an extra hour to do anything can be challenging.<\/strong> If you set yourself up in this manner, <em>you\u2019re setting yourself up to fail.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can\u2019t find that hour in one busy day, you likely skip it.

You may find it easier to grab those 10 minutes if you\u2019re already dressed in clothing that makes it easy to move around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have to search for the perfect yoga flow <em>and <\/em>take the time to do it, you might lose interest. <strong>Set yourself up for success well in advance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That may mean <strong>laying out your yoga clothes<\/strong> or simply dressing comfortably until after you\u2019ve done your yoga session for the day. Prepping for your yoga practice might require you to research an appropriate routine&nbsp;the day before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your prep work entails, make sure you get it done so that <strong>doing the yoga practice comes as second nature.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Enjoy the process.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like everything in life, <strong>you can\u2019t cheat your way through a yoga practice.<\/strong> Even if it\u2019s your goal to twist yourself into the lotus pose or perfect your inversions, you can\u2019t get there without going through a process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at the process of yoga as practice to get to the big move, you won\u2019t enjoy every minute of it. You may even get bored when you don\u2019t reach your goal as quickly as you expected, and you\u2019re <strong>more likely to ditch the practice<\/strong> at that point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga is a great metaphor for life. <strong>We set goals, and we work hard to reach them.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if we don\u2019t enjoy the process of reaching the goal, the mere act of living our lives would be frustrating, boring, and unsatisfying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to <strong>focus on the process of yoga, not just the goal.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"400\" height=\"401\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/funny-yoga-quote-about-sanskrit.jpg\" alt=\"funny yoga quote about sanskrit\" class=\"wp-image-6387\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/funny-yoga-quote-about-sanskrit.jpg 400w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/funny-yoga-quote-about-sanskrit-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/funny-yoga-quote-about-sanskrit-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/funny-yoga-quote-about-sanskrit-273x274.jpg 273w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga inherently encourages you to <strong>create a mind-body connection.<\/strong> The breathing techniques and movements that you practice while performing yoga help you to <strong>bring your mind into the present instead of focusing on the end result.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This used to be a difficult one for me and at times still is. &nbsp;<strong>I get frustrated with the process and the flaws in my practice.<\/strong> &nbsp;I want to be able to do certain poses, and it feels like my body is just taking ages to catch up to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Flexibility, weight loss, muscle tone, and the ability to sit still in savasana take time.<\/strong> &nbsp;Try to focus on how you <em><strong>FEEL<\/strong><\/em> during and especially after yoga practice. &nbsp;That euphoric feeling is what makes the process enjoyable. &nbsp;Listen to it and learn from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Reward good decisions.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We as humans have a tendency to <strong>perform the activities that give us short-term results<\/strong> rather than long-term ones. &nbsp;Trying to maintain a healthy diet is a GREAT example of this!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to eat healthily, but it&#8217;s way easier to eat convenient and tastier food. &nbsp;<strong>It&#8217;s easy to workout, but it&#8217;s way easier not to.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, when you\u2019re establishing yoga as a healthy habit, <strong>don\u2019t set unattainable goals.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your goal is to simply do 10 minutes of yoga a day, you\u2019ll be able to reward your good decision daily. If your goal is to do a specific set of challenging poses for an hour a day, it\u2019s going to be harder to reward yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reinforce your good decisions by making your goals easy to attain.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Do it from home.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have to pay money for a class or gym membership, drive to a specific location and get there early enough to secure a spot, you might be investing more time than you have, especially if you\u2019re just starting out. Make establishing your healthy yoga routine easier by <strong>doing it from home.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You won\u2019t have to work extra time into your day, and you won\u2019t have to spend extra money. You can literally do yoga in your underwear if you do it from home!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\u2019re the kind of person who doesn\u2019t feel motivated unless you\u2019re taking a class if you\u2019ve followed steps 1-3, doing yoga from home is an ideal way to get the habit established.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex and I have actually designed a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">yoga program<\/a><\/span> based on all of these principles. &nbsp;Okay, the workouts are 30 minutes, not 10. &nbsp;But you will have the tools to be able to design your own practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if 10 minutes is all you have, you can do that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with&nbsp;everything you need to get started, including&nbsp;a <strong>complete 12-week workout plan, a flexibility guide, and a beginner&#8217;s guide to meditation!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"258\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Avocadu-Yoga-Fat-Loss-Bible.png\" alt=\"Avocadu Yoga Fat Loss Bible\" class=\"wp-image-26019\" title=\"Avocadu Yoga Fat Loss Bible\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Avocadu-Yoga-Fat-Loss-Bible.png 600w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Avocadu-Yoga-Fat-Loss-Bible-300x129.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Avocadu-Yoga-Fat-Loss-Bible-365x157.png 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Avocadu-Yoga-Fat-Loss-Bible-355x153.png 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a&nbsp;great solution around for those looking to <strong>lose weight, get more flexible, and relieve aches and pains<\/strong> with a calm yoga practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will show you exactly how to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>melt away stubborn body fat<\/strong><\/a><\/span> with a regular yoga practice and has the top 50 fat-burning yoga poses every beginner should learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check it out by&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">clicking here!<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always remember that the&nbsp;most difficult part of doing yoga SHOWING UP. &nbsp;Make sure to show up today and give your best&nbsp;to this workout.
