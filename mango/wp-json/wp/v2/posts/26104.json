Feeling like you don&#8217;t have time for the gym? These 30-minute full-body fat-burning workouts should come in handy!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might want to burn fat and get a lean physique, but you don\u2019t have all the time in the world. If it takes two workouts a day and tons of equipment to lose weight, you may never succeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You don\u2019t need to go to the gym to get an effective workout, and you also don\u2019t need a lot of time.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plenty of workouts involve simple equipment or use only your body weight. How do you know which ones are the best? That depends on your <strong>body type, fitness level and exercise goals.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll discuss some<strong> tips for helping you burn fat.<\/strong> We\u2019ll also give you several options for 30-minute fat burning workouts that are generally effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See? You can get a great workout without magically adding more hours to your day! Here are some great tips before we get in to the actual workouts&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mix Up Your Workouts<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve probably heard it before. <strong>Your body gets used to doing the same thing over and over again.<\/strong> What was challenging for your muscles last month might not be that effective today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing up your workouts can help your body use different muscles, redistribute its balance and burn more fat. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/workouts\/workout-tips\/6-ways-burn-more-fat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Muscle and Fitness<\/a>, you can even make a single workout burn more calories by <strong>alternating bodyweight movements using <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2qnZPDH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">strength equipment<\/a> with bodyweight movements.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, after using the leg press, do a set of lunges. After doing lat pulls, do some pushups. This adds to the challenge and can improve the cardiovascular experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/54248-controlling-your-hunger.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Live Science<\/a> delivers a persuasive argument for shorter exercise sessions. A short, tough workout can suppress hormones that make you hungry. On the contrary, light to moderate exercise can make you want to refuel immediately afterward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Experimenting with different types of exercise can help regulate your hunger throughout the week.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Spot Train Your Trouble Areas<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/workouts\/workout-tips\/6-ways-burn-more-fat?page=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Muscle and Fitness<\/a> also suggests that you can boost fat loss by spot training. This technique was once considered to be a myth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the most benefits, do continuous training that targets a specific area using a high number of repetitions. Immediately after the strength-training workout, do 30 minutes of cardio. That\u2019s one way to make a 30-minute exercise session work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea behind this is that <strong>cells around the working muscle discharge more fat into the bloodstream when you do continuous strength training.<\/strong> Continuing to exercise following that lipolysis gives that fat something to fuel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What\u2019s Up With The Fat-Burning Zone?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever noticed that some apps and exercise machines have a fat-burning zone? The fat-burning zone is typically a heart-rate range that\u2019s fairly moderate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellfit.com\/how-to-burn-more-fat-secrets-of-exercise-physiology-3498340\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Very Well<\/a>, this fat-burning zone is somewhat of a myth. Your body will burn more fat in relation to total calories burned when moving at a slower pace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you walk for 30 minutes and burn 180 calories, 108 of those calories might come from fat. However, if you run for 30 minutes, you might burn 400 calories, with 120 of those calories coming from fat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running still burns more total calories as well as more fat calories than lower-intensity exercise even if the ratio of fat calories to total calories is lower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re trying to pack more fat-burning into a 30-minute workout, you\u2019ll fare better if you exercise at a higher intensity.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Should You Exercise On An Empty Stomach?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have heard that working out as soon as you jump out of bed can help you burn fat. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/working-out-on-an-empty-stomach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Axe<\/a>, it\u2019s not necessarily beneficial to exercise on an empty stomach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand this, it helps to learn how your body uses fuel for energy. <strong>When you exercise, your body can burn either glycogen, which comes from carbohydrates, or fats.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you sleep, your glycogen levels decrease. When you work out with low glycogen levels, your body uses fat for energy instead, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/breakingmuscle.com\/learn\/the-right-way-to-lose-fat-how-to-exercise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Breaking Muscle<\/a>. However, your body might also try to pull energy from the protein in your muscles, which wouldn\u2019t be as beneficial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One study published in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/british-journal-of-nutrition\/article\/breakfast-and-exercise-contingently-affect-postprandial-metabolism-and-energy-balance-in-physically-active-males\/9DAC8DE59DEEF7926E81FF2BB2C5B7EB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">British Journal of Nutrition<\/a> found that active males who exercised on an empty stomach before breakfast burned around 20 percent more body fat than those who ate first. They didn\u2019t compensate by eating more later, either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21411835\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">another study<\/a> published in the International Journal of Sports Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism determined that eating a light meal before doing moderate endurance exercise helped participants burn more body fat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line is that you should do what feels best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Five 30-Minute, Full-Body, Fat-Burning Workouts<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PopSugar Fitness Tabata Workout<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This workout is based on Tabata training. You\u2019ll do short bursts of maximum-intensity exercise with 10 seconds of rest in between.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the exercises will get your heart rate up. Others focus on strength and resistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workout requires no weights. Therefore, you can do it at home, at the office or while traveling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch the workout <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XIeCMhNWFQQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>&nbsp;or below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XIeCMhNWFQQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Christine Salus 30-Minute Total Body Cardio Workout<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another workout that requires no equipment.
