the body&#8217;s ability to process nutrients effectively. <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a lot like a power surge to your computer&#8211;too much energy (glucose) fries your system!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you feel like you don&#8217;t eat a lot of carbs or sugar, you could be getting them from sneaky sources like high-sugar fruit (bananas, grapes, etc.) and starchy or sugary veggies (like potatoes, peas or corn).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, simply being sedentary can increase your risk of insulin resistance, because your body doesn&#8217;t want to absorb energy (glucose) that it can&#8217;t use right away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a lot of visceral fat (internal fat around organs) rather than or in addition to subcutaneous fat (which is right under the skin) can also lead to insulin resistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will look like a body type that has a lot of abdominal fat, and even people who are &#8220;skinny-fat&#8221; without actually being overweight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts believe that <strong>excess visceral fat leads to lipid accumulation in the liver<\/strong>, which then causes &#8220;impaired insulin signaling&#8221; and\/or inflammation of the cytokines, &#8220;which impair insulin action.&#8221; (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4038351\/#:~:text=The%20mechanisms%20by%20which%20visceral,draining%20into%20the%20portal%20vein.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads to a vicious cycle of fat that causes insulin resistance, and insulin resistance that causes increased weight gain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Exactly is Insulin Resistance?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/diabetes\/insulin-resistance-symptoms#BloodWork3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Healthline<\/a> defines, <strong>insulin resistance is a condition that results from the body\u2019s ineffective use of insulin and generally leads to diabetes if left untreated.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you eat something sugary or high carb (which easily converts to sugar), your body dumps the glucose into your bloodstream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sends a signal to your pancreas to produce insulin, which binds to the glucose and carries it into your cells to be used as energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you&#8217;ve already loaded your cells up with glucose and insulin, they become resistant to absorbing more&#8211;which means the glucose stays in your bloodstream, and your pancreas has to make more and more insulin until your body gets the sugar out of your bloodstream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your pancreas can&#8217;t make enough insulin to keep up with the glucose, then you have reached type 2 diabetes&#8211;which means without intervention, sugar will continue to build up in your bloodstream, causing very serious health problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to all the issues that unregulated blood sugar cause, sugar that builds up in your blood coats your hemoglobin (blood protein). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes it sticky, raising your risk of cardiovascular disease, blood clots, and blood vessel damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even people who appear to be a healthy weight can experience insulin resistance, so weight alone is not the deciding factor in evaluation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how can you tell if your health is being impacted by insulin resistance?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Insulin Resistance Symptoms + How to Know If You Have It<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to be certain that you are experiencing insulin resistance symptoms is to visit your doctor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your doctor can order an A1C test, which measures the average amount of blood sugar you&#8217;ve had in your bloodstream over the last three months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mayo Clinic states that this test delivers a result that tells your doctor how your blood sugar history looks. A normal A1C is any number under 5.7, while anything over 5.7 indicates a potential for diabetes (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/tests-procedures\/a1c-test\/details\/results\/rsc-20167939\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Numbers above 6.5 on multiple tests indicate diabetes, and your doctor will prescribe a course of action that may include medication or insulin injections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, common symptoms of insulin resistance may hint at a problem <strong>before you see a specialist.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many individuals suffer from insulin resistance for years before noticing symptoms, since the early signs are fairly subtle. Symptoms can include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Weight gain&nbsp;<\/em><\/li><li><em>Chronic fatigue<\/em><\/li><li><em>Brain fog<\/em><\/li><li><em>High blood pressure<\/em><\/li><li><em>High cholesterol<\/em><\/li><li><em>Extreme hunger or thirst<\/em><\/li><li><em>Frequent urination<\/em><\/li><li><em>Tingling in the hands and feet<\/em><\/li><li><em>And more<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you ignore these symptoms, full-blown diabetes may develop, which causes even worse issues.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Severe complications of untreated diabetes include blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, stroke, and loss of toes, feet, or legs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to ensure your health and well-being is to see your doctor or a specialist to find out if your symptoms are related to diabetes or insulin resistance, or another condition entirely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Common is Insulin Resistance?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Heart.org reports that <strong>insulin resistance affects more than 60 million Americans.<\/strong> While it can lead to the development of diabetes, it is possible to live with insulin resistance without a formal diagnosis (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.heart.org\/HEARTORG\/Conditions\/More\/Diabetes\/AboutDiabetes\/About-Diabetes_UCM_002032_Article.jsp#.WXHBnIgrJhE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthline recommends that all people over age 40 undergo testing for diabetes, along with cholesterol and other general tests.

Thirty minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (like a brisk walk) at least five times a week is all you need to improve your cardiovascular health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A PubMed study found that physical activity led to increased insulin sensitivity following exercise. When individuals with insulin resistance exercised, their bodies used insulin more easily (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10683091\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effects of exercise lasted for about sixteen hours after the study\u2019s participants stopped their physical activity, which means their blood sugar levels may benefit longer than previously thought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, losing even a small amount of weight can reduce your insulin resistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/agamatrix.com\/blog\/insulin-resistance-diet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Melissa Dierks, RDN, LDC, CDCES<\/a>, \u201cA weight loss of 7-10% your current body weight can help prevent pre-diabetes from developing into type 2 diabetes. So, if you weigh 250 lbs., even a 17 lb. weight loss can make a difference.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional research shows that for every two pounds you lose, your risk of developing diabetes drops by 16%.

You and your doctor can then collaborate on the best course of action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are already diabetic, your treatment will likely range from one to all of the following: taking doctor-prescribed medication, monitoring your food and specifically carbohydrate intake, or injecting insulin daily (only in extreme cases).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But please <em>beware of jumping right on medication to fix your problems. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Medication will help manage your problems and symptoms, but insulin resistance CANNOT be reversed without a <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">change in your diet<\/a> and avoiding the foods that caused your problems in the first place.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your blood sugar stabilizes and your body\u2019s systems are functioning optimally, exercise can also help you keep them in check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever stage of insulin resistance you&#8217;re in, don&#8217;t give up hope!
