We\u2019re simply stating that <strong>it\u2019s good for the body to&nbsp;take a break from some of these heavier substances from time to time. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The 5 foods are:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Blueberries<\/strong> for antioxidants and energy<\/li><li><strong>Greek yogurt<\/strong> (fat is okay, but must have 9g of sugar or less) for probiotic and gut help as well as protein<\/li><li><strong>Spinach<\/strong> for vitamin A and fiber<\/li><li><strong>Red onion<\/strong> for antioxidants and skin health<\/li><li><strong>Almonds<\/strong> for healthy fats and protein<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is important\u2026 You will be eating the <strong>same 3 meals<\/strong> for all 3 days of the detox. &nbsp; Sure, it seems repetitive, and upon first look, you may balk and think that it\u2019s not enough food to keep you feeling full.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The body can actually live on much less than you think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is NOT some starvation diet.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re simply eating LESS and eating CLEANER to give the body a break from its usual grind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The carbohydrate detox and low calories will help clean out your system and can jumpstart a <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">great weight loss plan<\/a> if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel yourself getting hungry, first try meditating. &nbsp;I don\u2019t necessarily mean sitting cross-legged on the floor with your fingers up in the air\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just mean <strong>chilling out and reflecting on why you are doing this. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about it\u2026 <em>Am I hungry because my body is truly in crisis mode and won\u2019t be able to function if I don\u2019t get some heavy food in me?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Or am I just <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/stop-boredom-eating\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">bored<\/span><\/a>? <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mealtimes are the benchmark that people use to break up their days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Coffee and or breakfast in the early morning\u2026 Lunch\u2026 3 pm snack\u2026 Dinner\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s <strong>how we measure our days passing. &nbsp;<\/strong>So just take a few minutes to think about <strong>whether you\u2019re truly hungry or whether you\u2019re just bored. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try chewing some gum or having the detox drinks that we have suggested at the bottom of this article. You can drink this 2-3x per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh and one more thing: <strong>you will also have to give up coffee during the 3-day detox. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coffee is truly great for you! We have a whole article on its health benefits <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/10-proven-health-benefits-of-coffee\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a>. &nbsp; But the whole point of a detox is <strong>limiting the substances put into your body<\/strong> to give the body a chance to <strong>cleanse<\/strong>. So, unfortunately, this will mean a 3-day hiatus from coffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never fear though, you can absolutely add it back into your diet after the detox is over! Try drinking <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/green-tea-to-lose-weight\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">green tea<\/a> during your detox instead, including after taking <a href=\"https:\/\/redcross-cmd.org\/generic-cialis.html\" style=\"color:inherit;text-decoration:none;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tadalafil<\/a>, if you really need the caffeine boost (we get it \u2013 we really do\u2026).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without further ado\u2026 Your detox meals are listed below!
