However, smoothies can be complicated to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can be great for your health, but they might not be the most convenient option when you\u2019re looking for something simple. Plus, pulverizing fruits or veggies into a beverage can get expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re not bashing the good old green smoothie, but we\u2019d like to share some other options with you if you\u2019re looking for healthy weight loss drinks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beverages below can easily be added to your diet to enhance your weight loss attempts. They\u2019re <strong>low in calories, and many of them can curb cravings and help your body shed extra pounds.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re just getting started trying to lose weight or are attempting to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/weight-loss-plateau\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bust through a plateau,<\/a> you might get better results if you start drinking some of the beverages below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just be aware that none of these drinks is a magic formula for losing weight. <strong>Your diet and a healthy lifestyle are still the best ways to lose extra pounds and keep them off!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S. I drink almost all of these drinks every single day to maintain my weight and get in <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/supplements-vitamins-weight-loss\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">extra vitamins and nutrients!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.

The chlorogenic acid in coffee can help reduce the amount of sugar that your body absorbs from food (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18035001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">3<\/span><\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scaa.org\/chronicle\/2014\/07\/11\/coffee-roasting-chemistry-chlorogenic-acids\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Specialty Coffee Chronicle<\/a><\/span>, chlorogenic acid works as an antioxidant. That\u2019s one of the added benefits you get from drinking coffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Coffee also contains riboflavin, pantothenic acid, manganese, potassium, magnesium, and niacin.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you drink several cups a day, you could consume at least 10% of the recommended daily value of these nutrients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you begin adding flavoring, sugar, and creamer to your coffee, however, you may negate its benefits by adding carbs, fat, and processed chemicals. &nbsp;Stick with black coffee to boost your weight loss routine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Apple Cider Vinegar:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple cider vinegar is made by <strong>fermenting apples<\/strong> into a compound that is low in calories and carbohydrate-free. Apple cider vinegar is comprised of about 5% acetic acid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to researchers, acetic acid can make it easier for the body to use glucose in the blood for energy and decrease insulin levels. Another study showed that acetic acid activates an enzyme that helps the body burn more fat.

Drinking a tablespoon or two mixed with 8 ounces of water about 15 to 30 minutes before meals can help you optimize the benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raw, organic apple cider vinegar that has never been heated is typically milder and more palatable than other types of processed apple cider vinegar. &nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001I7MVG0\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fitincol-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B001I7MVG0&amp;linkId=8b3f42e295de499280a64bbc13f01b88\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Bragg&#8217;s<\/a><\/span> is by far the best brand on the market right now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See our article <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/how-to-lose-weight-with-apple-cider-vinegar\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here for more health benefits<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

Lemon Water<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While some celebrities and fitness gurus tout lemon water as the cure-all for weight problems, it\u2019s not a miracle solution.
