An ordinary chair is all you need for most!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you always wanted to try Barre, but the thought of doing a class with all those fit girls in their leg warmers and sticky socks knocks you out of your comfort zone?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel ya, girl.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a barre studio across from us when we were living in Austin, and I used to walk by and see them doing all kinds of crazy stuff in there. Talk about being <em>intimidated<\/em>. I wasn&#8217;t walking in there to give <em>that<\/em> a go anytime soon, I&#8217;ll tell you that much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It can be daunting to try new things, especially when it comes to working out.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody wants to be the one flailing around on the mat without a clue what they are doing while the girl next to do is just picture perfect ballerina <em>(or yogi, kickboxer, etc. &#8211; they all apply).<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, barre classes and studios can also be pretty expensive. It costs money to get a rockin\u2019 ballerina body!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s also time-consuming<\/strong> to have to load your workout stuff, get to the gym, do the class, then haul your sweaty self home to take a shower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I&#8217;m beginning to sound like I&#8217;m making a LOT of excuses for working out, right?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just that <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/at-home-workout-routines-no-equipment-required\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">working out from home<\/a> is so much better! You don\u2019t have to worry about the hole in your leggings, your undone hair, or how graceless you think you look while doing pli\u00e9s pulses or arabesques.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there are tons of barre videos online to help you get started. Here are 10 of our favorites that will help strengthen, lengthen, and tone that glorious body of yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tutu is <em>optional<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.
