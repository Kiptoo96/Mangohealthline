While you may have always thought intense exercise would promote the quickest fat loss, the secret is actually in your diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we eat matters a lot. Nutrients and minerals all have specific jobs to help our bodies function and learning how to eat a healthy diet will improve your overall health, not just promote fat loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our program teaches you all about nutrition and diet. We have compiled a diet guide that teaches you what different nutrients and minerals do for your health, and which ones you want to cut back on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, protein is like a superhero nutrient! It promotes fat loss while the body is at rest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.virtahealth.com\/blog\/why-dont-need-dietary-carbohydrates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Carbohydrates <\/a>on the other hand actually don\u2019t provide our bodies with anything we need, so you\u2019ll want to cut back significantly on those. We even include a list of approved and non-approved foods for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By following our diet guide closely, you will learn all about how to eat right and still enjoy the number on the scale going down. Focusing on your diet will boost your overall health and promote fat loss, it\u2019s a total win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice we didn\u2019t say you\u2019ll need to permanently change your diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though you will need to commit to a lifestyle change. Speaking of commitment\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Committing To Change<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-committment-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Focus On Fat Loss by committing to it\" class=\"wp-image-36251\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-committment-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-committment-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-committment-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-committment-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-committment.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve found that one of the biggest reasons people struggle with fat loss is a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/make-losing-weight-a-habit-when-youre-busy-and-unmotivated\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"26697\">lack of motivation.\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commitment takes some serious self-discipline and motivation. You simply cannot complete a fat loss challenge if you aren\u2019t committed to the process. In fact, you can\u2019t get the body results you desire without committing to a lifestyle change even after the program ends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to fully commit to the challenge to see the results you desire, and build and maintain healthier habits after the challenge ends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why we consider commitment such a big part of our program. You must strive to show up as your best self every day to achieve the results!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With commitment being so important, we have created a motivation guide that is included with our challenge. The motivation guide acts as a safe space for you to visit when you\u2019re feeling unmotivated and uninspired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also provide a progress tracker to boost your motivation, and we\u2019ve created a support group for you to join! Connecting with other women who are also completing the fat loss challenge will offer you support, motivation, and accountability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Committing to change can be difficult, but it\u2019s so worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We understand the importance of boosting your commitment and motivation, which is why our program incorporates those concepts so heavily. By committing to change, you will live a healthier lifestyle and boost your fat loss.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Showing Up Every Day&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-2-women-walking-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Focus On Fat Loss by showing up to walk with women\" class=\"wp-image-36250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-2-women-walking-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-2-women-walking-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-2-women-walking-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-2-women-walking-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Focus-On-Fat-Loss-with-2-women-walking.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>While this ties into the concepts of commitment and motivation, the importance of showing up every day cannot be overlooked. Our challenge is 21 days long and if you miss a day, it\u2019s best to restart it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chose 21 days for a very specific reason, and that is because it takes the average person 21 days to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/build-healthy-habits-for-weight-loss\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"26106\">form a habit<\/a>. To fully form a new habit, you must show up every single day or it may not stick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this may seem strict, it\u2019s in your best interest.
