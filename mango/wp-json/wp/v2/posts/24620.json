This makes you want to eat more sugary or fatty food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.livestrong.com\/article\/64566-foods-trigger-release-dopamine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Livestrong<\/a><\/span>, other foods that cause a dopamine release are proteins, natural produce, cheese, and chocolate. However, <strong>the effects don\u2019t last as long as when you consume sugar,<\/strong> so you might be more likely to reach for sweets if given the option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, eating healthy foods that provide a moderate release of dopamine helps you feel good without experiencing withdrawal symptoms. These foods don\u2019t act like opioids and steer you toward addiction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re craving sugar, you might be craving a dopamine release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>E<\/strong><strong>ating healthy options can satisfy that craving while keeping the addictive results at bay.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try some <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00JBC9WW0\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fitincol-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00JBC9WW0&amp;linkId=80daf0a897a76f9991cbdbf62064c594\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">protein powder<\/a><\/span> in unsweetened almond, coconut, or cashew milk to whip up a quick protein shake!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Retrain Your Brain<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Eating is a survival mechanism. Carbohydrates are necessary for energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If we\u2019re feeling fatigued, we tend to reach for the thing that is going to give us the quickest pick me up. That\u2019s usually something that\u2019s loaded with sugars or carbs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can retrain your brain to use healthier carbohydrate energy by filling up on <strong>healthy carbs<\/strong> instead. One of the keys may be to avoid restricting yourself entirely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some healthy carbohydrate options are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Nuts<\/strong> \u2013 1 cup of almonds has 26 grams of carbs<\/li><li><strong>Sweet potatoes<\/strong> \u2013 1 large sweet potato has 37 grams of carbs<\/li><li><strong>Kale<\/strong> \u2013 3 cups of chopped kale saut\u00e9s down to nothing and contains 21 grams of carbs<\/li><li><strong>Steel-cut oat<\/strong>s \u2013 \u00bc cup of dry oats contains 27 grams of carbs<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When you eat these healthy carbs, you are training your brain to get the energy it needs without added refined sugar. Also, you will feel&nbsp;full&nbsp;because you can eat larger amounts of these healthy foods without the calorie punch that sugary treats will give you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This retrains your brain to look for healthier foods for energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Manage Stress<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we feel bad, we often reach for something that makes us feel good. One of those things is sugar. &nbsp;If you manage your stress levels, you can stop cravings before they start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some ways to manage stress are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Practice meditation \u2013 <\/strong>YouTube is stocked with thousands of guided meditations that can help you get started if you\u2019ve never meditated before. &nbsp;Headspace is also a great app that has a free version.<\/li><li><strong>Get enough sleep \u2013<\/strong> Nothing seems easy if you\u2019re sleep deprived.

Reset Your Insulin Sensitivity<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Insulin is a hormone that unlocks sugar that enters the bloodstream from the foods that you eat and allows your body to use the glucose for energy. When you consume sugar, insulin immediately reacts, removing that sugar from your blood and using or storing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, <strong>insulin regulates blood sugar.<\/strong> If you consistently eat sugar, you may develop insulin resistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that <strong>your body doesn\u2019t react efficiently when you eat sugar.<\/strong> More and more insulin gets sent out, but it doesn\u2019t remove the glucose from your bloodstream as well as it should.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your body essentially stops listening to the signals it\u2019s getting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because <strong>your body isn\u2019t able to effectively transform the glucose into energy, you want to eat more sugar.<\/strong> Too much sugar in the blood can lead to a variety of health problems, including type 2 diabetes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you encourage your body to become more sensitive to insulin again, you can <strong>better stabilize your blood sugar and eliminate cravings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do this by <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">gently detoxing<\/a><\/span> and then slowly adding healthy carbohydrates back into your diet. To detox, eliminate all major sources of sugar from your diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t consume artificial sweeteners, honey, maple syrup or anything else that you would consider a sweet. Lay off of grains and dairy too.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concentrate on eating non-starchy vegetables, protein, and healthy fats for at least a week. Fill up on these foods, and eat a variety of foods to stay satisfied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about it, <strong>there are so much more options for flavors, textures, and colors when it comes to fresh vegetables and meats.<\/strong> If you feel bored or unsatisfied while detoxing, it\u2019s probably because you haven\u2019t made eating healthy convenient enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prep a week\u2019s worth of salads filled with chopped veggies, roasted vegetables, and cooked protein so that you don\u2019t have to think twice about what to eat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After 7 to 10 days, gradually begin to add healthy carbs back into your diet. Your body will be much more efficient at using insulin, and your blood sugar will stay more stable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll find that you don\u2019t crave sugar like you used to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6.
