So, when bringing the right leg up, flex the right glute. &nbsp;Bring the leg up as high as you can, and hold for one second before lowering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the working leg is on the ground, immediately bring the next leg up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do this exercise for 2 full minutes for 3 total sets. &nbsp;It makes it easier if you do it in front of the TV while watching your favorite show!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.

Bret Contreaus, known as the glute guy, was the one who popularized the movement and also&nbsp;teaches people how to add weights to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring the hips to the top, flex the glute muscles, and hold for 3 seconds before lowing back down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perform 20 repetitions in a row before breaking.

The goal is to come down to where your&nbsp;back knee is 1 inch from the floor and then to come right back up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, remember to squeeze the glutes at the top of the movement!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do 10 on each side before moving to the next.

At the top of the movement, flex the glute before bringing the knee&nbsp;back down. &nbsp;Once the knee comes back down, repeat the movement on the same leg again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeat on the same leg for 12 repetitions before switching legs. &nbsp;Complete 3 full sets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6.
