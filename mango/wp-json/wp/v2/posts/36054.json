We\u2019ve found that the most effective way to lose weight quickly is to adjust your diet and eating habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people think that intense exercise is the best way to lose weight, but the science shows us otherwise. Nutrition and diet play the biggest role in your weight loss, so you want to follow our guidelines very closely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/programs.avocadu.com\/p\/21-day-fat-loss-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\">Avocadu fat loss program<\/a> contains a lot of information regarding nutrition and diet. We give you a list of approved and non-approved foods, a daily meal guide, recipe ideas, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, did you know that protein actually helps the body\u2019s metabolism and helps us feel full? This is just one of many nutrition tips our program contains.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cutting back on carbohydrates is another important element of losing weight. Simple carbohydrates don\u2019t actually offer our bodies anything we need to survive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are the only non-essential nutrient we eat. It\u2019s so important to cut back on these carbohydrates as you\u2019re trying to lose weight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthy fats and complex carbs are okay to consume in small portions when you\u2019re trying to lose weight, but ditch the simple carbs and empty fat calories!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Related: <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/weight-loss-after-45\/\"  rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>Fast Weight Loss for Women Over 40: How to Do It Right<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.

People think fasting is dangerous, unhealthy, or just simply doesn\u2019t help when it comes to weight loss, but this is really not true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barring any pre-existing medical conditions, fasting is safe as long as it\u2019s done correctly. That being said, you can\u2019t fast for a week straight and expect to not experience adverse health effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/programs.avocadu.com\/p\/21-day-fat-loss-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\">Our program<\/a> incorporates fasting, which can and will boost your weight loss efforts. The scientific benefits of fasting include reduced body fat levels, appetite control, reduced risk of disease, better mental focus, and much more. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a 24 hour fast on day one that lasts from 5:00 p.m. on day one until 5:00 p.m. the next day, meaning you will not have to go an entire day without eating. Note &#8211; this is not to say you won\u2019t be allowed to consume liquids. In fact, you must drink water throughout day one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Related: <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/benefits-of-fasting\/\"  rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>11 Proven Benefits of Fasting (Weight Loss, Concentration, and More)<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6.

The two exercises we incorporate into our program are daily walks and resistance based circuit training.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking daily walks boosts your mental health as well as mobilizing the fat on your body. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Resistance based circuit training is considered the holy grail of weight loss exercises because it increases your heart rate while helping you build lean muscle. Incorporating these two exercises into your day will absolutely boost your weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7.
