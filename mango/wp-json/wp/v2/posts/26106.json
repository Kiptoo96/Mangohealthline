Remembering that old friend who gushed about how amazing you look can help remind you that you\u2019re becoming more confident.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stepping on the scale and seeing that the number has, in fact, gone down can make you put down that second helping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are our favorite ways to build healthy habits for weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Reward Yourself<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You often hear people talk about <strong>rewards<\/strong> when it comes to weight loss. However, if you\u2019re used to rewarding yourself with food, it can feel challenging to give yourself an effective pat on the back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tie your reward to your motivation.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that bikini is keeping your weight-loss dreams alive, buy one that you love when you hit your first weight-loss goal. Instead of holding out for your favorite pair of jeans, purchase a pair that fits you like a glove and doesn\u2019t dig into your love handles when you\u2019ve lost the first 5 pounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you start feeling more energetic, take the family on a special outing. Go to the zoo or hike to a scenic overlook to take advantage of your newfound vigor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Set Small Goals<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Try setting small, realistic, and specific goals when you\u2019re trying to shed weight.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have your sights set too high, you might get discouraged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you compliment someone on his or her weight loss, you often get the reply, <em>\u201cThanks. I still have 20 pounds to go!\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the compliment was probably a great reward for that person, the reminder of the ultimate goal is still a major hurdle. If that person had set smaller goals along the way, he or she may have responded, <em>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ve already hit my first two goals!\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What a difference it makes to <strong>satisfy smaller goals<\/strong> than to plod along toward an unreachable one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jerry Seinfeld used this strategy to train himself to be more productive and be a better comic, according to an <a href=\"http:\/\/lifehacker.com\/281626\/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interview<\/a> between software developer Brad Isaac and the comedian himself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seinfeld set a goal to write every day. If he accomplished the goal, he would mark a red \u201cX\u201d on the calendar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/build-healthy-habits-for-weight-loss-by-setting-goals.jpg\" alt=\"build healthy habits for weight loss by setting goals\" class=\"wp-image-26161\" title=\"build healthy habits for weight loss by setting goals\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/build-healthy-habits-for-weight-loss-by-setting-goals.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/build-healthy-habits-for-weight-loss-by-setting-goals-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/build-healthy-habits-for-weight-loss-by-setting-goals-365x244.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/build-healthy-habits-for-weight-loss-by-setting-goals-355x237.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Within less than a week, it wasn\u2019t important to him to write something hilarious. It was just important that he didn\u2019t break the chain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Skipping one day makes it easier to skip another day.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to making this strategy work is to <strong>keep your goals small enough that they\u2019re easy to accomplish every day.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Make a Decision<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever said that you were going to try to lose weight?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trying isn\u2019t the same as doing.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re going to try to stay away from the cheese plate at a party, you\u2019re likely to gorge on cheddar cubes at some point. If you say, <em>\u201cI\u2019ve decided not to eat the cheese tonight,\u201d<\/em> you\u2019re more likely to avoid it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be confident in your ability to stick to your decisions. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re confident about your plans, you\u2019re more likely to follow them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Trick Your Willpower<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that <strong>willpower is a finite resource <\/strong>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.apa.org\/helpcenter\/willpower-limited-resource.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The more you deprive yourself, the more likely you are to ditch all self-control by the end of the day.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting study involved putting participants in a room with freshly baked cookies and radishes. One group was told that they could sample the cookies. The other group was asked to eat the radishes instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants were then asked to complete a difficult puzzle. The group that had sampled the cookies had more self-control. They persevered for a longer period of time than the radish-eating group while completing the puzzle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group that had used willpower to avoid eating the cookies gave up on the puzzle more quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you\u2019ve been restricting yourself all day, you\u2019re more likely to give up on your healthy eating habits in the evening.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of limiting your food options, expand them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some ways to do this are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Eat all the vegetables you want for every meal.<\/em><\/li><li><em>Concentrate on getting a variety of colors on your plate.<\/em><\/li><li><em>Experiment with new cooking techniques, spices and flavorings.<\/em><\/li><li><em>Eat something every few hours.<\/em><\/li><li><em>Have fun with food.<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kp-qzIvG2XI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this video<\/a> for more on this phenomenon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Move Every Day<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people think that if they don\u2019t pound out a hard jog or lift heavy weights at the gym, it\u2019s not worth working out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with this mentality is that it may make you burn out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Developing a habit involves consistency.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you burn out and stop exercising for a week, you\u2019ve just taken a few steps back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make an effort to move your body daily. You don\u2019t have to do HIIT training or run three miles; you just have to do <em>something.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could involve doing a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/free-20-minute-yoga-workout-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">20-minute yoga flow,<\/a> dancing in your living room, taking a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/walking-to-lose-weight\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">15-minute walk<\/a> twice a day or playing Frisbee in the park.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight.jpg\" alt=\"daily walk to lose weight\" class=\"wp-image-7088\" title=\"build healthy habits for weight loss by going for daily walks\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You may notice that the more you move, the more you want to move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Exercising earlier in the day can help you take advantage of your willpower to keep your healthy habit going.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Set Up Triggers<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you used to eating something sweet after a meal? Do you tend to grab something crunchy while you\u2019re watching TV?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are <strong>unhealthy triggers.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lifehacker.com\/how-to-trick-your-brain-to-create-a-new-healthy-habit-868231704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lifehacker<\/a> suggests tricking your body into wanting to follow healthier triggers by doing something healthy instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go for a 5-minute walk after a meal. Do 50 crunches every time you sit down to watch TV. Get up and do a household chore every 15 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These triggers don\u2019t have to be long or complex. Keeping them <strong>short and simple<\/strong> <strong>may be the best way to change your negative habits into lifelong healthy behaviors.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, if you need a program to help you establish healthier habits, we&#8217;ve got you covered.
