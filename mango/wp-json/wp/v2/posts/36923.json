The answer lies in our genes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.gov\/publications\/dictionaries\/cancer-terms\/def\/nutrigenomics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nutrigenomics<\/a>, a cutting-edge field of study, seeks to understand the complex interaction between our genetic makeup and our diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, nutrigenomics is about personalization. It recognizes that we&#8217;re all unique, from our physical features to our genetic code.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition simply doesn&#8217;t work. Instead, nutrigenomics enables you to tailor your diet according to your genes, optimizing your health in a way that&#8217;s uniquely suited to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By understanding how your genes interact with different foods and nutrients, you can tailor your diet to fit your body&#8217;s unique needs. Here are some examples of how nutrigenomics comes into play:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Caffeine Metabolism<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain genetic variations can affect how your body processes caffeine. For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-caffeine-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Biohacking caffeine\" class=\"wp-image-36931\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-caffeine-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-caffeine-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-caffeine-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-caffeine-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-caffeine.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fast metabolizers quickly break down caffeine<\/strong>, often feeling its energizing effects for a shorter period.

For instance, some people have a genetic variant that affects the metabolism of Vitamin B6, which plays a vital role in brain development and function.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can lead to a deficiency despite adequate dietary intake and may necessitate a higher dietary intake or supplementation to meet the body&#8217;s needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Response to Fats<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Different people metabolize fats differently based on their genetic makeup.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some individuals might have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ahajournals.org\/doi\/10.1161\/CIRCGEN.118.002192\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">variant in a gene<\/a> that leads to increased levels of LDL (&#8220;bad&#8221;) cholesterol when they consume saturated fats, increasing their risk of heart disease.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these people, a diet low in saturated fats might be beneficial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through nutrigenomic testing and a deeper understanding of your genetic profile, you can gain insight into these and many other dietary factors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can guide you to make more personalized choices about your diet and lifestyle, paving the way for improved health and wellness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nootropics and Smart Drugs: The Quest for Enhanced Mental Performance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-nuutropics-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Biohacking nuutropics\" class=\"wp-image-36941\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-nuutropics-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-nuutropics-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-nuutropics-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-nuutropics-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-nuutropics.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to biohacking, the brain is just as much a playground as the body. An increasingly popular arena within biohacking circles revolves around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/vitamins-and-supplements\/features\/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nootropics<\/a> and smart drugs.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Promising improved cognitive function, enhanced creativity, heightened motivation, and sharpened memory, these substances have caught the attention of those eager to give their mental performance a boost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Caffeine:<\/strong> Yes, your morning coffee is a nootropic! Known for its stimulating effects, caffeine enhances alertness and can help improve concentration. It&#8217;s an accessible first step into the world of nootropics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>L-Theanine:<\/strong> Often found in <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/10-incredible-health-benefits-of-matcha-green-tea-powder\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"3613\">green tea<\/a>, L-Theanine is said to promote relaxation without drowsiness. When combined with caffeine, it can help smooth out the stimulant&#8217;s jitters and extend its cognitive-boosting benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Modafinil:<\/strong> Originally designed for treating sleep disorders, Modafinil is now popular off-label as a cognitive enhancer. Users report increased alertness, improved focus, and reduced fatigue. However, it&#8217;s prescription-only and its long-term effects are still not fully understood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Racetams:<\/strong> This family of drugs, including Piracetam, Aniracetam, and Oxiracetam, are often used to boost memory, focus, and mood. Despite widespread use in the nootropic community, scientific research on their effects is limited, and they are not approved by the FDA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adaptogens:<\/strong> These natural substances, including herbs like <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3XGjA70\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Ashwagandha<\/a> and Rhodiola Rosea, are used to help the body adapt to stress and promote a sense of calm and focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids:<\/strong> Commonly found in fish oil, Omega-3s are essential for brain health. They are associated with improved mood and cognitive function and can be obtained through diet or supplementation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the world of nootropics and smart drugs, while exciting, should be navigated with caution. Some substances have robust scientific backing, while others have only anecdotal evidence or limited research. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The long-term effects of many smart drugs are still not fully understood, and their legal status can vary depending on the country and whether they are prescribed for specific conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that cognitive enhancement also extends to non-drug strategies, such as mindfulness practices, sleep optimization, and maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Intermittent Fasting: Harnessing the Power of Strategic Eating<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-intermittent-fasting-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Biohacking intermittent fasting\" class=\"wp-image-36936\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-intermittent-fasting-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-intermittent-fasting-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-intermittent-fasting-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-intermittent-fasting-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-intermittent-fasting.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One popular practice among biohackers that has gained mainstream attention is intermittent fasting (IF).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional diets that focus on what to eat, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/intermittent-fasting-for-weight-loss\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6227\">intermittent fasting<\/a> is all about when to eat. It involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting, thereby giving your body a chance to tap into its fat stores and burn them off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Weight Loss and Fat Burning<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Intermittent fasting has proven effective in aiding weight loss, and for a good reason.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the fasting period, your insulin levels drop, and your body changes its primary energy source from glucose to stored fat, helping you burn off excess weight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, fasting periods can reduce overall calorie intake, further promoting weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Improved Metabolic Health<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By regulating when you eat, intermittent fasting can help stabilize blood sugar levels, improve insulin resistance, and reduce inflammation, contributing to improved metabolic health.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not only beneficial for weight management but also helps reduce the risk of developing various metabolic diseases like <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/prevent-pre-diabetes-becoming-diabetes\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8099\">diabetes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Potential Increase in Lifespan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although research is still ongoing, some studies suggest that intermittent fasting may extend lifespan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could be due to the combination of weight management, improved metabolic health, and the triggering of certain cellular repair processes that occur during the fasting state, such as autophagy, where your cells self-cleanse and remove damaged components.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mental Clarity<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many practitioners of intermittent fasting report heightened mental clarity and concentration during fasting periods.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could be because, in the absence of glucose, the body starts producing <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Raspberry-Ketones-weight-loss-pill-reviewed.jpg\" data-type=\"attachment\" data-id=\"26375\">ketones<\/a>, a type of molecule that may be particularly beneficial for brain function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intermittent fasting is a powerful tool in the biohacker&#8217;s arsenal, but it&#8217;s important to remember that everyone&#8217;s body responds differently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, you should consult with a healthcare provider before starting a new regimen like intermittent fasting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the potential benefits are exciting, the key is finding a sustainable eating pattern that fits into your lifestyle and contributes to your overall health and well-being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sleep Optimization: The Secret Ingredient for Peak Health<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-sleep-optimization-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Biohacking sleep optimization\" class=\"wp-image-36944\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-sleep-optimization-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-sleep-optimization-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-sleep-optimization-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-sleep-optimization-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-sleep-optimization.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that good sleep is important for our health, but how much do we really understand about achieving quality sleep?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the realm of sleep optimization, a cornerstone of biohacking that aims to enhance your sleep quality and, by extension, your overall health and well-being.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it can make a difference:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sleep Tracking Technology<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The advent of wearable technology has revolutionized our understanding of sleep. Devices like <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3XF9gfr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">smartwatches<\/a> and fitness trackers offer detailed insights into your sleep patterns by monitoring factors like sleep duration, stages, and interruptions.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By analyzing this data, you can identify areas for improvement and track the effectiveness of your sleep-enhancing strategies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Light Therapy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our bodies&#8217; sleep-wake cycles, or circadian rhythms, are significantly influenced by light.

Let&#8217;s dive deeper into how this works with some examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>High-Fiber Diet:<\/strong> Some individuals might have a gut microbiome rich in bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, known for their ability to break down dietary fiber into beneficial compounds like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These SCFAs have numerous health benefits, from reducing inflammation to supporting a healthy immune system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, a diet rich in fiber from foods like fruits, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/fibrous-carbs\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"29782\">fibrous vegetables<\/a>, whole grains, and legumes can support these bacteria and promote overall gut health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Low-FODMAP Diet:<\/strong> On the other hand, some people might experience gut discomfort due to a surplus of bacteria that ferment specific types of carbohydrates, known as FODMAPs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A personalized low-FODMAP diet, which minimizes foods like onions, garlic, and certain fruits and legumes, can help reduce these symptoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mediterranean Diet: <\/strong>Research has shown that a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/mediterranean-diet-benefits\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"36309\">Mediterranean-style diet<\/a> rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats can increase levels of beneficial bacteria like Prevotella, linked to improved metabolic health.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone&#8217;s gut microbiome analysis reveals lower levels of these bacteria, adopting a Mediterranean diet might be beneficial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Probiotic and Prebiotic-rich Diet:<\/strong> If a person&#8217;s microbiome lacks diversity, incorporating a diet rich in probiotics and prebiotics could be advantageous.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probiotic foods like yogurt, kimchi, and sauerkraut can introduce beneficial bacteria, while prebiotic foods like artichokes, onions, and asparagus can nourish existing gut bacteria.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Personalized Nutrient Optimization:<\/strong> Microbiome analysis might also reveal how well a person metabolizes certain nutrients, leading to dietary adjustments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, some people might absorb omega-3 fatty acids more efficiently, prompting an increase in foods like fatty fish and flaxseeds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From eating for your gut bacteria to optimizing nutrient absorption, the concept of personalized diets truly embodies the saying &#8216;one man&#8217;s food is another man&#8217;s poison.&#8217;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an exciting area of biohacking that is blurring the line between nutrition and personalized medicine, reshaping how we think about food and health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Related Article: <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/healed-leaky-gut-ibs-in-2-months\/\">How I Healed My Leaky Gut, IBS, and Digestive Problems in 2 Months<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lifestyle Factors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-lifestyle-and-fitness.jpg\" alt=\"Biohacking lifestyle and fitness\" class=\"wp-image-36937\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond diet, other lifestyle factors can also impact the microbiome.

Using blackout curtains, eye masks, and eliminating light sources in the bedroom can ensure a dark environment that supports the body&#8217;s natural production of the sleep hormone melatonin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Light Timing and Jet Lag<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For frequent travelers, adjusting light exposure can help manage jet lag.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exposing oneself to bright light in the morning can help shift the body&#8217;s internal clock earlier (useful when traveling east), while exposure to evening light can delay the circadian rhythm (helpful when heading west).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The light around us \u2013 its intensity, timing, and color \u2013 is a powerful but often overlooked influence on our health.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By consciously managing light exposure, biohackers aim to align their lifestyle with their body&#8217;s natural rhythms, achieving improved sleep, mood, and energy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, however, that everyone&#8217;s body is different. What works best for one person may not work as well for another.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world of light exposure management illuminates yet another fascinating area in the realm of biohacking. By becoming more attuned to the light in our lives, we can potentially unlock brighter days and more restful nights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Embracing the Future: Biohacking&#8217;s Promising Path Forward<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-feature.jpg\" alt=\"Biohacking feature\" class=\"wp-image-36945\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As biohacking continues to evolve, it&#8217;s crucial to remember the importance of safety and effectiveness.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some of these practices have significant scientific backing, others require further research.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through biohacking, we are embarking on an exciting journey to unravel the complexities of human health and wellness.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"591\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-3-591x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Biohacking 3\" class=\"wp-image-36927\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-3-591x1024.jpg 591w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-3-173x300.jpg 173w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-3-768x1331.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-3-886x1536.jpg 886w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-3-1182x2048.jpg 1182w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-3-150x260.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-3-scaled.jpg 1477w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In your journey toward better personal health and wellness, you may have stumbled upon a fascinating trend: biohacking.&nbsp; This isn&#8217;t just a passing fad, but a strategic mix of science, nutrition, technology, and medicine, all designed to put the power of well-being right into your hands.&nbsp; With biohacking, you are the architect of your own&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":36945,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_kad_blocks_custom_css":"","_kad_blocks_head_custom_js":"","_kad_blocks_body_custom_js":"","_kad_blocks_footer_custom_js":"","_kad_post_transparent":"","_kad_post_title":"","_kad_post_layout":"","_kad_post_sidebar_id":"","_kad_post_content_style":"","_kad_post_vertical_padding":"","_kad_post_feature":"","_kad_post_feature_position":"","_kad_post_header":false,"_kad_post_footer":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[29],"tags":[],"taxonomy_info":{"category":[{"value":29,"label":"Healthy Living"}]},"featured_image_src_large":["https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Biohacking-feature.jpg",1024,683,false],"author_info":{"display_name":"Cathy Dean","author_link":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/author\/cathydean\/"},"comment_info":0,"category_info":[{"term_id":29,"name":"Healthy Living","slug":"healthy-living","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":29,"taxonomy":"category","description":"","parent":0,"count":128,"filter":"raw","cat_ID":29,"category_count":128,"category_description":"","cat_name":"Healthy Living","category_nicename":"healthy-living","category_parent":0}],"tag_info":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/36923"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/18"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=36923"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/36923\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":36947,"href":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/36923\/revisions\/36947"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/36945"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=36923"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=36923"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=36923"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
