There is a reason our clients and family are bursting with excitement on news feeds and via text messages when the weight is gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a strangely serendipitous feeling that happens when you receive an unsolicited compliment from a friend or family member on how great you look. &nbsp;<em>&#8220;Have you lost weight?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s mental &#8211; not just physical.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why these steps pay close attention to the mind game that is played with weight loss as much as the physical aspects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that just shouting at people to<em> \u201cEat Less and Move More\u201d<\/em> does <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">not<\/span> work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is obviously more to it than that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our experience with helping so many lose weight has taught us a few very important factors in losing 30+ pounds quickly and effectively! Here are our best tips for success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Stop Making Small Changes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The largest meta-analysis on weight loss success performed by the University of Alabama showed us that <strong>people who lose the most weight in the first 2-4 weeks end up with the best results in the long term.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, losing weight fast will better impact you in both the short term and the long term.&nbsp; The most effective thing you can do is actually a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/fastest-way-to-lose-weight-in-3-weeks\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fast weight loss approach.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This study and our experience show us that if you are&nbsp;going to lose weight, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">GO ALL IN<\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you half-ass it and just promise to add in the occasional salad to your diet, you\u2019re pretty much doomed to fail. &nbsp;Your results will come in too slowly and not give you enough momentum you from moving forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s an incredible motivation that comes from quick physical changes! &nbsp;Both science and common sense tells us this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why our <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/span><\/a> helps you lose 10-21 pounds in just the first 21 days of the diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Eat More of the Right Foods<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/healthy-protein-and-vegetables-meal.jpg\" alt=\"healthy protein and vegetables meal\" class=\"wp-image-28606\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/healthy-protein-and-vegetables-meal.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/healthy-protein-and-vegetables-meal-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/healthy-protein-and-vegetables-meal-365x243.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/healthy-protein-and-vegetables-meal-355x236.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest lessons I&nbsp;learned is that eating more of the right things is the true path to weight loss. Let\u2019s look at why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what people experience when they eat the right things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You naturally feel full after meals.<\/li><li>Your body gets more energy from the food you eat, leading to less crashing and cravings.<\/li><li>You get more sleep with better <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/how-hormones-affect-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">hormone regulation<\/span><\/a>.<\/li><li>This sleep leads to better craving control, better-looking skin, and other health benefits.<\/li><li>The metabolism moves faster from eating the right foods.<\/li><li>You build more lean muscle tissue, which improves resting calorie burn.<\/li><li>You start to get compliments from friends and family, leading to more motivation to eat the right things.<\/li><li><strong>This momentum keeps you moving forward.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what people experience when they eat the wrong things&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Your body feels empty and hungry.<\/li><li>The body gets less energy from the food you eat, leading to crashing and trying to fix the crash with more food or high-calorie drinks.<\/li><li>You get less sleep and even&nbsp;worse hormone regulation.<\/li><li>This lack of sleep or bad sleep leads to sugar cravings, poor skin health, and disease.<\/li><li>The metabolism moves slower from eating the wrong foods.<\/li><li>You lose lean muscle tissue, which decreases resting calorie burn.<\/li><li>Your friends and family stay silent about your weight, leading to more motivation to eat the wrong things and continuing along the same path.<\/li><li><strong>This lack of momentum keeps you moving backward.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Time and time again, I&nbsp;have seen that eating <u>the right foods<\/u>&nbsp;is EVERYTHING when it comes to weight loss. &nbsp;Lots of protein, water, and low carb veggies at every meal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Move Less<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait&#8230;&nbsp;<em>What? <\/em>Is that a typo?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are usually pretty jarred when I&nbsp;suggest something like that. &nbsp;The reason comes from both science and personal experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, a recent study done by Current Biology took 322 adults from 5 different countries through a calorie reduction weight loss program. &nbsp;They split the groups between those that did exercise and those that did not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shockingly enough, adding in exercise did not play ANY major role over calories burned or weight lost. &nbsp;And for those that saw changes, they were minor at best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The problem is that the \u201cmove more\u201d mentality puts people in the wrong mindset for weight loss success.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">NEVER<\/span> outwork or outrun a bad diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great workout burns about 300 calories.
