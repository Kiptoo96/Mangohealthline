It\u2019s because of the <strong>surges of estrogen they get during pregnancy, which causes hair growth.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After they have the baby and hormones start to adjust, they usually shed hair like crazy. Women who start or change birth control can also go through the same thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Estrogen makes your hair grow fast and furious<\/strong>, and sometimes in places that shouldn\u2019t have hair. If you\u2019ve ever been on birth control pills and had hair grow in weird places, you know what I mean.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/gallery\/0,,20723100,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thyroid disorders<\/a> can also have hair loss, or their hair gets brittle because of hormone fluctuations.

Diseases that cause hair loss like alopecia are a result of this, but any autoimmune issue can cause hair trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Emotional, physical, and environmental stressors are also big causes of poor hair quality<\/strong> because the body puts most of its energy toward the stress response instead of growing hair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feeling stressed all the time is not going to give you long, flowy tresses. But perhaps the biggest contributor to hair health is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eatthis.com\/foods-for-healthy-hair\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">diet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Protein, certain vitamins and minerals, and amino acids all contribute to how long and fast our hair grows, and whether it\u2019s healthy or not.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want luscious locks, switch to a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-100-pounds-simple-diet\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">healthy diet<\/a> filled with nutritious vegetables, fruits, and lean meats that are good for the body.
