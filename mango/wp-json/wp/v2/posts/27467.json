You can even <strong>get a little exotic and try bison or ostrich<\/strong>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Veggies can also be loaded with high-quality protein,<\/strong> especially legumes, grains like quinoa, hemp, chia seeds, and buckwheat.

I <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">LOVE<\/span> wine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry. This is also a <strong>temporary thing. It&#8217;s important to cut out alcohol for a period of time to help the detox process.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alcoholic drinks have a lot of calories and some are loaded with sugar. Margaritas usually have over 300 calories per serving, and a mudslide has more than 800!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you have to keep in mind that it&#8217;s not just the calories. Alcohol is essentially a <strong>poison<\/strong> that we are putting into our bodies. While it does have <strong>stress-relieving properties and some antioxidants if you&#8217;re drinking red wine, <em>it&#8217;s still never good for you.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It screws up the systems in your body and impairs your judgment, leading you to make bad food decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>How often has a few glasses of wine changed your mind about what your mind about that salad you were planning to eat for dinner or about sticking to your no-dessert policy during the week?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep, me too. It <em>SABOTAGES<\/em> my diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so you think you\u2019ll stick to a beer or one glass of wine. A beer has about 150 calories, while a glass of wine has 100. That doesn\u2019t sound so bad, does it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is if your goal is to lose 100 or more pounds. If you drink regularly, <strong>those extra empty calories are going to slow you down big time.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6.

A study at the University of Tokyo found that women who eat food with high-water content like vegetables have lower body mass and smaller waists than women who don\u2019t (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/gallery\/0,,20306719,00.html#water-weight-loss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They think that the extra water in food makes you feel fuller faster so you don\u2019t eat as much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know veggies can be capital B &#8211; <strong>BORING<\/strong>, but they truly are one of the secrets to sustainable weight loss. When can you ever eat as much as you want of something?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The key is to practice at making them DELICIOUS!<\/strong> My personal favorite is to <strong>roast veggies.<\/strong> Steamed veggies never turn out as good, in my opinion, and it&#8217;s much harder to spice them up just right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throwing them in the oven gives them an almost &#8220;barbequed&#8221; flavor. They are easier to cook that way (throw em&#8217; in with a timer and you&#8217;re done!), and it&#8217;s easy cleanup when you use foil over your pans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Break Up with Sugar<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots of healthy foods contain natural sugar in them, so you\u2019re never going to get rid of it completely<strong>. <\/strong><em>It will have to be like the ex that you\u2019re still friends with on social media<\/em><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main problem is <strong>added sugar,<\/strong> which can really bump up your carb and calorie intake. It\u2019s usually added to foods that have fat and refined starch, which definitely won\u2019t help with weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are consuming sugar in everything from your morning coffee to your dessert in the evening, it really adds up. It&#8217;s often in foods that you aren&#8217;t even aware of as well. This is again why we need to <strong>avoid all processed foods<\/strong> as much as possible!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How do you break your sugar addiction?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s easier said than done. We all know that. Perhaps you&#8217;ve even tried before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. <strong>The focus shouldn&#8217;t be on cutting out every single food that contains sugar out of your life forever.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not practical or enjoyable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The focus should instead be on replacing those bad eating habits with new, healthy habits. If you can do that, you will naturally think about sugar less and less.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, it will always be there tempting you to some degree. We aren&#8217;t going to promise that you won&#8217;t EVER crave sugar again. People that make that claim in their diets are just <em>mad<\/em>, in my opinion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you will think about it a lot LESS and be able to get it under control (a lot less binge eating&#8230;).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is exactly what we teach in our fast weight loss program, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>21-Day Fat Loss Challenge.<\/strong><\/a><\/span> It contains all of these principles (detox, healthy and balanced meals, whole foods, etc.) in a detailed an organized plan that will help you lose <strong>10-21 pounds in just 21 days.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"270\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/21-Day-Fat-Loss-Challenge-Program-by-Avocadu-min.png\" alt=\"21-Day Fat Loss Challenge Program by Avocadu\" class=\"wp-image-27338\" title=\"21-Day Fat Loss Challenge Program by Avocadu\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/21-Day-Fat-Loss-Challenge-Program-by-Avocadu-min.png 900w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/21-Day-Fat-Loss-Challenge-Program-by-Avocadu-min-300x90.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/21-Day-Fat-Loss-Challenge-Program-by-Avocadu-min-768x230.png 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/21-Day-Fat-Loss-Challenge-Program-by-Avocadu-min-365x110.png 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/21-Day-Fat-Loss-Challenge-Program-by-Avocadu-min-355x107.png 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s not a crash diet.
