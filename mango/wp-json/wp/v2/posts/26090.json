These top 5 books for weight loss motivation should help!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s tough to lose weight when you have no support. Accountability partners can help tremendously, but they&#8217;re often hard to come by.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, we have to turn elsewhere for our motivation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Books on dieting and weight loss can help give you ideas for different ways of eating, reinforce your goals, and even cheer you on.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of them even come with access to private communities set up by the author for additional accountability and encouragement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading these types of books can help you to remember that other people have dealt with the same challenges as you &#8212; and overcome them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No diet plan is perfect for everyone. That\u2019s why turning to a book for weight-loss motivation might be more effective than using one to plan your next diet.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the beauty of books is that they\u2019re relatively affordable. Therefore, you can try out different methods and motivation styles. These are some of our favorites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2qpkYx9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Half-Assed: A Weight-Loss Memoir &#8211; Jennette Fulda<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2qpkYx9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"169\" height=\"250\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/half-assed-weight-loss-motivation-book.jpg\" alt=\"half-assed weight loss motivation book\" class=\"wp-image-26392\" title=\"half-assed weight loss motivation book\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Many weight-loss books are filled with scientific and psychological facts about health and nutrition. Jennette Fulda\u2019s book takes a <strong>more personal approach.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a work of nonfiction that reads like fiction. It\u2019s even a satisfying beach read.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Fulda was 23, she had gallbladder surgery. She weighed 372 pounds at the time. She knew that her weight was gravely affecting her health, but it took her another year to take action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Her journey involves making better eating choices and making a commitment to exercise.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to relate to her story. When she started, she was unable to do more than walk. She eventually graduated to jogging, Pilates, and weight training.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Her writing is hilarious, and her story is honest.<\/strong> Fulda relays her setbacks and triumphs with authentic wit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a diet book on specific foods, this may not be the one for you. The author doesn\u2019t describe how or what she ate to lose weight. In fact, she is somewhat secretive about the specific diet she was on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you\u2019re looking for <strong>inspiration and relatability,<\/strong> you will find it in this book. The author is spot on when describing her weight-loss struggles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2qpkYx9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Click here to read more about it on Amazon.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2qp6NHX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">8 Minutes in the Morning \u2013 Jorge Cruise<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2qp6NHX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"205\" height=\"250\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/8-minutes-weight-loss-motivation-book.jpg\" alt=\"8 minutes books for weight loss motivation\" class=\"wp-image-26393\" title=\"8 minutes books for weight loss motivation\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This book involves more than a specific plan than some of the others that we talk about in this article.
