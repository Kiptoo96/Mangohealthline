The shoulder joint is further supported by a network of muscles, ligaments, and tendons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"691c78cb-42b7-4ce1-8832-5e32c5c5b08a\">Because of its complexity, the shoulder is susceptible to a range of injuries and anatomical problems that can cause pain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"691c78cb-42b7-4ce1-8832-5e32c5c5b08a\">Common causes of shoulder pain include rotator cuff injuries, bursitis, impingement syndrome, and adhesive capsulitis. Less common causes include fractures, dislocations, and tumors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"691c78cb-42b7-4ce1-8832-5e32c5c5b08a\">In many cases, shoulder pain can be treated with conservative measures such as ice, rest, and physical therapy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"691c78cb-42b7-4ce1-8832-5e32c5c5b08a\">However, more severe cases may require surgery. A thorough evaluation by a qualified physician is the best way to determine the cause of shoulder pain and develop an effective treatment plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yoga for Shoulder Pain Stretches<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b7fb891f-f89c-45e4-a4a9-feed08026c06\">These stretching exercises target the muscles and joints around the shoulder, helping to release tension and improve range of motion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Should Rolls<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/yoga-for-shoulder-pain-shoulder-rolls-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"yoga for shoulder pain shoulder rolls\" class=\"wp-image-35885\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/yoga-for-shoulder-pain-shoulder-rolls-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/yoga-for-shoulder-pain-shoulder-rolls-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/yoga-for-shoulder-pain-shoulder-rolls-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/yoga-for-shoulder-pain-shoulder-rolls-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/yoga-for-shoulder-pain-shoulder-rolls.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"5aa13f20-3177-486d-adff-7c12b1086935\">To do a basic shoulder roll, start by sitting up tall with your shoulders relaxed.

It&#8217;s sticking with it that can be a challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a8f8a851-7364-4a96-b427-d9bb3a6606fd\">There are a few things you can do, however, to help make sure you get the most out of your practice and keep coming back for more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a8f8a851-7364-4a96-b427-d9bb3a6606fd\">First, be realistic about how often you can realistically practice. If you try to do too much too soon, you&#8217;re likely to get burnt out and end up quitting altogether. It&#8217;s better to start slow and gradually increase your frequency as you start to see results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a8f8a851-7364-4a96-b427-d9bb3a6606fd\">Second, find a style of yoga that suits you and your goals. There are many different types of yoga, so there&#8217;s sure to be one that&#8217;s a good fit for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a8f8a851-7364-4a96-b427-d9bb3a6606fd\">If you&#8217;re not sure where to start, try taking a few different classes until you find one that feels right. Finally, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a8f8a851-7364-4a96-b427-d9bb3a6606fd\">If you&#8217;re struggling with a particular pose or aspect of your practice, seek out a teacher or experienced practice who can offer guidance and support.
