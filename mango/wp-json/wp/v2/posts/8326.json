Understand What Whey Protein Is<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whey is the liquid part of milk that gets separated when cheese is made. &nbsp;If you\u2019ve ever opened a yogurt container and have seen a watery substance at the top, do not be afraid! This is whey protein.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This liquid substance is what is turned into powder form to create whey protein.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just in case you\u2019re wondering, this process also <strong>cuts out the 95% of the lactose.<\/strong> &nbsp;So if you\u2019re allergic to dairy, you have <strong>nothing to fear.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/plant-based-protein-sources-healthy-diet\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">plant-based protein powders<\/span><\/a> out there if you want one without whey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.

Understand How It Aids in Weight Loss<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three reasons that are particularly compelling\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>It will keep you full.<\/strong> Protein can cut down sugar cravings by as much as 60%.<\/li><li><strong>It\u2019s convenient.<\/strong> As long as you have a blender bottle on hand, all you need to do is add water.

Consider When You Take It<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order of importance:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take 30 minutes before or after your workouts.<\/strong> This has been shown to help with muscle development and recovery after a workout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take 30 minutes before meals or dining out.<\/strong> This will help you keep you from <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/stop-binge-eating-and-emotional-eating\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">binge eating<\/a> and give you more control over what you eat when out with friends or family members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finally, you can use it as a healthy snack. <\/strong>Whenever my chocolate cravings hit midday, I use it to get my chocolate fix without all the sugar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5.

Try to avoid using dairy milk as it usually contains sugar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other great places to add protein include <strong>oatmeal, Greek yogurt, and smoothies<\/strong> for a flavor boost. &nbsp;Try adding a little <strong>cinnamon<\/strong> as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This adds a great taste to the otherwise bland, healthy foods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Know How Much to Consume<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common dosage is <strong>25-50 grams a day,<\/strong> which will be 1-2 scoops depending on the brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no limit on the amount you can take, but since you should be getting protein from a variety of sources, any more than two servings a day is a bit gratuitous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, I recommend <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2ib1nwb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Dymatize ISO 100<\/a><\/span>. &nbsp;It tastes delicious and is low in sugar and carbs!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to also check out our article on <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/whey-protein-recipes\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Delicious Whey Protein Recipes<\/a>&nbsp;for more ideas on how to get it into your diet!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>if you liked this article on how to use protein powder for weight loss or have any questions, please leave them in the comment section below.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is whey protein a regular staple in your weight loss plan?
