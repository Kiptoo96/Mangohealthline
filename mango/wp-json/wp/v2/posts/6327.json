I suppose you could classify that as starvation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we are specifically talking about two of the most common types of fasting:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/intermittent-fasting-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">intermittent fasting<\/a><\/span> (up to 16 hours; i.e. skipping <em>one<\/em> meal in the morning or evening)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/%e2%80%8b24-hour-fasting-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">24-hour method<\/span><\/a> (not eating for 24 hours at a time; i.e. eating dinner one night and not eating until dinner the following night).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.

Intermittent fasting is quite effective at <strong>optimizing hormonal responses.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"345\" height=\"385\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/weight-loss-hormones-to-lose-weight.jpg\" alt=\"weight loss hormones to lose weight\" class=\"wp-image-6245\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/weight-loss-hormones-to-lose-weight.jpg 345w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/weight-loss-hormones-to-lose-weight-269x300.jpg 269w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/weight-loss-hormones-to-lose-weight-246x274.jpg 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, it can help <strong>improve your insulin sensitivity, boost your growth hormone (HGH), normalize your leptin, and can help with cellular discharge.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, it impacts the stress hormone, cortisol, which can also affect weight gain and weight loss. On that note, we&#8217;ll move on to our next benefit of fasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">2. More Resistant to Stress<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know stress is bad. We just tend to ignore the facts.

Unloading anything on your plate and making you more conscious of how you are living your day can only help to improve stress as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

It&#8217;s more that positive diet and lifestyle changes can only help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of whether it&#8217;s a benefit of fasting or not, the best study so far behind this claim is the <strong>positive effects fasting has on those going through chemotherapy.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who received 4 cycles of chemo used 48-hour fasting protocols to minimize side effects.
