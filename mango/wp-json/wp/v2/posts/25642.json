You consistently gain weight when you\u2019re not losing it.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This sounds strange, but the <strong>average American does gain weight each year<\/strong> according to the research&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 2000 study in the New England Journal of Medicine&nbsp;found that adults between the ages of 25 and 44 gain between 3.4 and 5.2 percent of their body weight each year (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJM200003233421206#t=article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1<\/a>). That\u2019s a <strong>yearly increase of 7.5 pounds for a 150-pound woman.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your norm is to <strong>gain and not just to maintain,<\/strong> it can seem to take double the effort to lose weight. Working to <strong>maintain your weight first<\/strong> can give you a better baseline to work from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. You\u2019re lying to yourself.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are all dishonest with ourselves in so many ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps you <strong><em>are <\/em><\/strong>losing weight, but you just aren\u2019t meeting an <strong>unrealistic goal.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you <strong><em>tell <\/em><\/strong>yourself that you\u2019re counting calories, but you give yourself a <strong>freebie<\/strong> when you\u2019re in the break room at the office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might complain that you work out 7 days a week, but most of your gym time is spent <strong>chatting with friends.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be honest with yourself about your weight loss attempts.<\/strong> It can be difficult to come to terms with this awareness, but it can help you understand <strong>what\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/weight-loss-plateau\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">really hampering your weight loss efforts<\/a> and help you meet your goals.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. You\u2019re eating something that your body doesn\u2019t like.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a reason that&nbsp;everyone is <strong>cutting out gluten and dairy these days.<\/strong> &nbsp;More and more diet plans are heading towards this conclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/dairy-foods-for-diabetics-min.jpg\" alt=\"inflammatory foods like dairy is a common reason you can't lose weight\" class=\"wp-image-7674\" title=\"inflammatory foods like dairy is a common reason you can't lose weight\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Compounds in both can be <strong>triggers for autoimmune disease.<\/strong> People can also be <strong>sensitive to gluten and dairy<\/strong> even if they don\u2019t have an autoimmune disease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your body can be sensitive to just about any food or chemical. If a food causes inflammation or <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/unhealthy-gut-warning-signs\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">intestinal damage<\/a>, it can interfere with the nutrients that your body does absorb and make it hard to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to find out if you\u2019re sensitive to a certain food is to become keenly aware of your body, test out what happens when you<strong> eliminate and re-introduce the food<\/strong> and be honest with yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the bottom of this article, we&#8217;ll talk more about our <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a>, which eliminates potentially inflammatory foods for a period of 21 days to help you jumpstart your weight loss. &nbsp;This will help you determine how your body responds to certain foods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. You\u2019re drinking too much.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re not talking about water here. In fact, if you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/drinking-water-lose-weight\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drinking enough water,<\/a> you can actually improve your body\u2019s ability to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you\u2019re drinking too much alcohol or too many <strong>sugar-laden beverages,<\/strong> you may have trouble losing weight. This can happen <strong>even if your total caloric intake is restricted.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alcohol and sugary drinks aren\u2019t good for you for many reasons, but they can <strong>lower your metabolism and prevent your liver from functioning properly.<\/strong> This can leave you with <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-belly-fat-fast\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>excess fat,<\/strong><\/a> especially around your abdomen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. <strong style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 48px; letter-spacing: -0.0415625em;\">Your cheat day is out of control.<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many dieters allow themselves a way out in the form of a <strong>cheat meal or cheat day.<\/strong> Allowing yourself to slip up for a moment is one thing, but <strong>bingeing yourself into oblivion<\/strong> is another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"501\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/cheat-day-dieting-meme.jpeg\" alt=\"cheat meal dieting meme\" class=\"wp-image-25646\" title=\"cheat meal dieting meme\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/cheat-day-dieting-meme.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/cheat-day-dieting-meme-150x150.jpeg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/cheat-day-dieting-meme-300x300.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/cheat-day-dieting-meme-273x274.jpeg 273w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/cheat-day-dieting-meme-265x266.jpeg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We&#8217;ve all been there&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your cheat day involves doughnuts for breakfast, an entire pizza for lunch and a fast-food dinner chased down by several beers and an ice cream cone, you might be sabotaging any efforts that you\u2019re making to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real talk&#8230; <strong>Small rewards WORK.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a concept that works very effectively in our <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge,<\/a> but there are very specific rules regarding how much you can eat and how long it lasts. &nbsp;It&#8217;s very important to keep these boundaries in place so that you don&#8217;t go overboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. You\u2019re not letting yourself feel hungry.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many diets claim to help you lose weight without the hunger. Experiencing natural feelings of hunger and satiety can be good for your waistline, though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shying away from hunger can lead you to <strong>eat for comfort or to eat too many small meals<\/strong> throughout the day, contributing to a <strong>higher calorie count.<\/strong> Your body won\u2019t use your own fat for energy if you\u2019re constantly supplying it with fuel through food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We advocate a <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">diet<\/a> that helps you LISTEN to your body and determine when you are actually hungry and when you are simply eating out of boredom (it happens FAR more often then you think!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. You\u2019re distracted.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Research shows that mindful eating can help you lose weight, change your eating behaviors and even reduce psychological distress (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21130363\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turn off the TV and look away from your smartphone while you eat. When you notice that you\u2019re not hungry anymore, put away your plate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you live with a family member or friend, try to make mealtimes a <strong>community activity.<\/strong> &nbsp;It will help you pay attention to what you are eating as well as <strong>connect with others.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you live alone, light a candle and take some down-time to eat your meal. &nbsp;It will help you relax and <strong>lower your cortisol (stress) levels.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. You\u2019ve been doing the same thing for too long.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re actively trying to lose weight, things shift after a little while. The weight stops dropping so noticeably and your metabolism begins to change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re doing any kind of weight loss program, give yourself a break periodically. Maintaining your weight loss is just as important as achieving it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focusing on staying at the same weight for a while can <strong>help your body reset<\/strong> so you can ultimately continue and reach your goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guys, this goes back to the importance of a cheat meal in your weight loss journey. &nbsp;Not only does it give you motivation, but it helps to give your body a break from extreme dieting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. You\u2019re not sleeping well.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/trouble-sleeping-1.jpg\" alt=\"trouble sleeping\" class=\"wp-image-29106\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/trouble-sleeping-1.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/trouble-sleeping-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/trouble-sleeping-1-365x242.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/trouble-sleeping-1-355x235.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re sleep deprived or don\u2019t get adequate rest, your <strong>metabolism can suffer.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep problems can also <strong>mess with your body\u2019s hunger and satiety mechanisms,<\/strong> making you feel hungry even when you\u2019re not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See&nbsp;our article on the <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/health-benefits-of-sleep\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>importance of sleep<\/strong><\/a> for further reading on how sleep impacts your hormones, weight loss, and much more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>10. You don\u2019t have enough stomach acid.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Dr. Ann Louise Gittleman, stomach acid helps the gall bladder secrete bile, which <strong>helps break down fat<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/annlouise.com\/2013\/05\/28\/the-digestive-glitch-that-blocks-weight-loss\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3<\/a>). Stomach acid helps the liver and the pancreas do their job and <strong>break down the right nutrients at the right time.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people have low stomach acid, which can surprisingly be the cause of <strong>heartburn<\/strong>. If enough acid isn\u2019t available to help digest the food in your stomach, your stomach muscles will do most of the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This pushes food up into your esophagus, causing heartburn. You end up taking an antacid, which makes your esophagus feel better but further exacerbates the problem, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/chriskresser.com\/what-everybody-ought-to-know-but-doesnt-about-heartburn-gerd\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chris Kresser<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping your body to produce enough stomach acid (by reducing your intake of antacids or by supplementing with HCl) could help you lose weight if this is the problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also highly recommend Chris Kresser&#8217;s book, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2jVmCjx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">The Paleo Cure<\/a>, if you&#8217;re looking for a good book to read on dieting and overall health. &nbsp;He talks in-depth about inflammatory foods as they pertain to your diet as well as other common health topics, including sleep, exercise, and meditation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>11.

You\u2019re using exercise as an excuse to eat more.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When people exercise too intensely while also aggressively dieting, they tend to eat back all of the calories (and more) that they just burned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re left feeling <strong>utterly famished<\/strong> and like you &#8220;deserve&#8221; a snack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that you might not be creating the <strong>calorie deficit that your body needs<\/strong> to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t look at exercise as a free pass to eat more; weight loss happens <strong>primarily as a result of your diet.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another concept that we advocate HEAVILY in our <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Plan<\/a> for this reason and others. &nbsp;Exercise is often too difficult and even damaging to the body when people reach a certain weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-weight-weighing-200lbs\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how to lose weight if you weigh 200 lbs<\/a> or more for additional insight here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>13. You\u2019re eating fake sugar.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your body responds to more than just calories in foods. Your brain is responsible for setting your body up to <strong>receive and process nutrients.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Dr. Hyman explains, when you trick your brain into thinking it will be getting sugar by eating calorie-free sweeteners, you set off <strong>physical and hormonal responses that make you gain weight<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2010\/06\/19\/artificial-sweeteners-could-be-sabotaging-your-diet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">5<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other problem with this is that substituting sugar for artificial sugar does not help&nbsp;you solve the underlying problem, which is your <em>behavior<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A detox from sugar helps to change these eating habits and is another key concept in our diet plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>14.

You don\u2019t have realistic expectations.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point, you\u2019re going to reach a healthy weight that works for <em>you<\/em>. Despite what you see on TV and in magazines, some body goals are unachievable due to genetics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t use genetics or hormones as an excuse, but <strong>be realistic<\/strong> about&nbsp;your weight loss goals and&nbsp;do not compare yourself to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as YOU are&nbsp;on a journey towards becoming a healthier you, you&#8217;re on the right track!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Solution<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If something is not happening the way that you want it to, the quickest solution is to become <strong>aware of the problem.<\/strong> You can\u2019t fix a problem if you don\u2019t know what needs to be fixed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of focusing on the solution, focus on completely observing what is actually going on right now.
