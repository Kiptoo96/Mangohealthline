Cardio is necessary\u2014and very good for you\u2014and it should be included in our routines, but only doing cardio is not the best way to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or at least not the way to lose weight fast, and then keep it off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, an excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-lose-weight-quickly\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">non-diet way to lose weight is yoga<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people completely disregard yoga as an effective way of losing weight because they think it&#8217;s just a bunch of stretching and careful breathing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And honestly, it can be that, if that&#8217;s what YOU want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the beauty of yoga is that it can be whatever you make it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally use yoga specifically to<strong> build muscle and burn fat<\/strong>, and it&#8217;s AWESOME for that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga is probably one of the best and <em>oldest<\/em> forms of <strong>strength training.<\/strong> If you&#8217;ve ever seen some of the crazy poses some people do with yoga, you would understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>But you don\u2019t care about all that right?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You just want to lose some weight!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Yoga for Weight Loss \u2013 And Your Physical Well Being <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel I should add a caveat here&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many forms of yoga, so it\u2019s imperative you realize that <strong>not all forms are going to offer you equal chances at weight loss.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is simply because <strong>not all yoga is aimed at strength training.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said before &#8212; some yoga is centered around meditation and careful breathing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CDC (Center for Disease Control) says that adults should include <strong>moderate or intense strength training activities<\/strong>\u2014that involve all major muscle groups\u2014at minimum, 2 days a week. (<a href=\"https:\/\/health.gov\/paguidelines\/second-edition\/pdf\/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf#page=55\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And reading a bit further in that report you\u2019ll see it also says that you have to do it until it hurts&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haha okay, that\u2019s not what it says!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What it actually says is, <strong>\u201cmuscle-strengthening exercises should be performed to the point at which it would be difficult to do another repetition.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>i.e. bringing your muscle to the point of exhaustion.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you\u2019re thinking of taking up yoga for weight loss, it should be a more intense form of yoga. Because you do need to feel that muscle burn!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And consider one more thing. One of the key factors that make weight training better for weight loss is that <strong>your body continues to burn calories even after you\u2019ve completed your workout<\/strong>\u2014whatever it might be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One study concludes that your metabolism remains boosted up to 38 hours after a workout.
