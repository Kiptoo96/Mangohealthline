They keep your menstrual cycles in check and play a massive part in fertility.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Weight Connection:<\/em> They also like to keep your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/womens-metabolism-and-weight-loss\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"36362\">metabolism<\/a> on its toes. Estrogen helps in building lean muscle mass, and when it pairs with its buddy progesterone, it sometimes makes you hungrier (looking at you, PMS!).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cortisol:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>What it does:<\/em> Say hello to the &#8216;stress hormone&#8217;.

It helps control your blood sugar levels by ushering glucose into cells where it&#8217;s used for energy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Weight Connection<\/em>: If you\u2019re a bit too indulgent with carbs and sugars (no judgment!), your body might become <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/insulin-resistance-and-weight-loss\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27038\">resistant to insulin<\/a>\u2019s charms.

Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s really happening when Aunt Flow is preparing to make her grand entrance:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Early to Mid-cycle (Follicular Phase):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Estrogen Rises:<\/em> In this first half, estrogen is the social butterfly that is out on the town. It generally makes you feel good, and your energy levels are up.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Appetite and Metabolism:<\/em> Your appetite might be a bit more in check, and your body burns calories efficiently. This is a great time to focus on workouts and nutritious eating.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ovulation:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Estrogen Peaks and Progesterone Joins:<\/em> Around the middle of your cycle, estrogen is at its peak, and then it takes a dip. Progesterone, not wanting to miss out on the fun, starts to rise.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Body&#8217;s Fuel Preference: <\/em>Interesting tidbit &#8211; during this time, your body tends to use fat as fuel during workouts, so it\u2019s an awesome time for some endurance exercises.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Late Cycle (Luteal Phase):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Progesterone Takes Center Stage:<\/em> Progesterone is now living its best life. But here\u2019s the catch &#8211; it sometimes makes you feel like a bottomless pit.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Appetite and Cravings:<\/em> This is when you might want to eat all the carbs and sweets in sight. The trick is to be prepared. Keep <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/low-carb-snacks-weight-loss\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8053\">healthier snack options<\/a> handy, and maybe allow yourself a little treat so you don\u2019t feel deprived.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Water Retention and Bloating<\/em>: Progesterone loves to throw a bloating party. It\u2019s not actual weight gain, though, so don\u2019t panic. Stay hydrated, and maybe avoid super tight jeans.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Just Before Your Period (Late Luteal Phase):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Hormones Decline:<\/em> Both estrogen and progesterone decide to take a break. For some of us, this is when PMS hits like a freight train.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Mood Swings and Fatigue:<\/em> Feeling like an emotional wreck or just plain worn out is common. This is the time to pamper yourself. Think self-care and relaxation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Menstruation Begins:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Cycle Repeats: <\/em>The curtain closes, and Aunt Flow arrives. Your hormones hit the reset button, and the cycle starts anew.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Ease into it:<\/em> The first couple of days of your period might be tough. Listen to your body. If you need to ease up on the workouts and curl up with a hot water bottle, that\u2019s perfectly fine.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Estrogen and progesterone are like that dynamic duo that can either make or break your day (or week). Being in tune with your cycle and planning accordingly can make things a smidge easier.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you\u2019re going through is natural, and you\u2019re not alone in this hormonal roller coaster ride.

Let\u2019s look at the pregnancy journey through the eyes of your hormones:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Early Pregnancy (First Trimester):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><a href=\"https:\/\/my.clevelandclinic.org\/health\/articles\/22489-human-chorionic-gonadotropin#:~:text=Human%20chorionic%20gonadotropin%20(hCG)%20is,about%2010%20weeks%20in%20pregnancy.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)<\/a>:<\/em> This is the star hormone that gets the ball rolling. It tells your body, \u201cHey, we\u2019re pregnant!\u201d and helps maintain the early stages of pregnancy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Progesterone and Estrogen Rise:<\/em> These two are back at it again, making sure the uterine lining is ready to nurture the embryo.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Relaxin:<\/em> A newcomer, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yourhormones.info\/hormones\/relaxin\/#:~:text=Relaxin%20is%20a%20hormone%20produced,softens%20and%20widens%20the%20cervix.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">relaxin<\/a>, helps your body (you guessed it) relax. It loosens ligaments and joints to make room for your growing baby. Watch your balance, though!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Weight Gain:<\/em> Typically not much in the first trimester, but don&#8217;t worry if you gain a few. Morning sickness might also cause weight fluctuations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mid-Pregnancy (Second Trimester):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Appetite Increases:<\/em> As nausea settles, you might feel hungrier. Baby\u2019s growing and needs nourishment!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Insulin:<\/em> Your body needs more insulin during pregnancy, and sometimes it doesn\u2019t produce enough. Keep an eye on this with your healthcare provider to make sure gestational diabetes doesn\u2019t crash the party.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Weight Gain:<\/em> This is when you might start gaining more weight. It\u2019s not just the baby, but extra blood, fluids, and the placenta. Embrace it, darling &#8211; your body is doing something incredible!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Late Pregnancy (Third Trimester):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Cortisol and DHEA:<\/em> These hormones increase towards the end of pregnancy. They help mature your baby\u2019s organs and play a role in the timing of birth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em><a href=\"https:\/\/medlineplus.gov\/lab-tests\/prolactin-levels\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Prolactin<\/a>:<\/em> This is gearing you up for breastfeeding.

Your healthcare provider will guide you on healthy weight gain.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Water Retention: <\/em>Swelling might be your not-so-favorite accessory during this time.

Go, oxytocin, go!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Energy Levels:<\/em> You might feel a burst of energy right before birth or be totally exhausted. Either way, your body knows what it\u2019s doing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Pregnancy is like a marathon, where your hormones are the tireless cheerleaders.

When it comes to your body, your thyroid can be that friend. It\u2019s like it can&#8217;t make up its mind if it wants to chill out or go into overdrive. Either way, your weight is along for the ride.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meet the Thyroid:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Control Center: <\/em>Your thyroid is this butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, and it\u2019s kind of a big deal. It regulates metabolism, energy levels, and even how your body uses fats and carbs. So basically, it\u2019s the DJ of the hormone party.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hypothyroidism (The Chill Friend):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>What Is It?:<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-weight-with-hypothyroidism\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"26705\">Hypothyroidism<\/a> is when your thyroid decides to take it easy and doesn\u2019t produce enough thyroid hormones. It\u2019s like it\u2019s constantly in weekend mode.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Weight Gain:<\/em> One of the classic signs is weight gain or difficulty losing weight. Your metabolism slows down; it\u2019s like it\u2019s always in sloth mode.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Fatigue and More:<\/em> Besides weight gain, you might feel tired, have dry skin, and experience some hair loss.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>What to Do:<\/em> If you suspect you have hypothyroidism, it\u2019s time to visit your healthcare provider. They can check your thyroid levels and discuss treatment options, which usually include medication to help your thyroid get back on track.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hyperthyroidism (The Overzealous Friend):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>What Is It?:<\/em> This is when your thyroid is like, \u201cLet\u2019s do this!\u201d and produces too much thyroid hormone. It\u2019s like it chugged a bunch of energy drinks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Weight Loss:<\/em> You might lose weight without trying. Sounds great, but it\u2019s not the healthy way to do it. Your heart can also race, and you might <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/stop-gaining-weight-from-anxiety\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"32240\">feel anxious<\/a> or irritable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>What to Do:<\/em> Just like with hypothyroidism, it\u2019s super important to chat with your healthcare provider. They might prescribe medication to calm your thyroid down, or discuss other treatment options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keeping an Eye on Your Thyroid:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Regular Check-ups:<\/em> Regular check-ups are key. Your thyroid levels can change over time, and it\u2019s good to stay on top of them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Diet and Lifestyle: <\/em>Eating well and staying active is always a good idea, but with thyroid issues, it\u2019s even more important. Some people with thyroid issues find that certain diets help manage their symptoms.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>Support:<\/em> Dealing with a thyroid disorder can be tough, both physically and emotionally. Don\u2019t hesitate to lean on friends, family, or find a support group.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Your thyroid is like that finicky friend that needs some extra attention sometimes. The most important thing is to listen to your body. If something feels off, it\u2019s worth investigating. Your thyroid might just need a little TLC to get back in the groove.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stress and Hormones<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Hormonal-Changes-Affect-Weight-Loss-stress-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Hormonal Changes Affect Weight Loss stress\" class=\"wp-image-36549\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Hormonal-Changes-Affect-Weight-Loss-stress-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Hormonal-Changes-Affect-Weight-Loss-stress-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Hormonal-Changes-Affect-Weight-Loss-stress-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Hormonal-Changes-Affect-Weight-Loss-stress-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Hormonal-Changes-Affect-Weight-Loss-stress.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s time for some real talk about stress.
