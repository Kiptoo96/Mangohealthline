You will want to <strong>consume lots of water, almost no carbohydrates, and allow your body to completely detox\/cleanse.<\/strong> This is the hardest phase when it comes to weight loss, but it should result in <strong>7-8 pounds of weight loss in the first WEEK!<\/strong> Make sure to eat lots of <strong>low carb vegetables and lean protein.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good examples are broccoli, spinach, asparagus, cauliflower, lean chicken breast, grass-fed beef, lean turkey breast. The best fats are olive oil for salads and coconut oil to cook with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>DAYS 9-13: Protein and Veggies<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This your peak time to <strong>increase quantities of protein, low carbohydrate vegetables, and fats.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also consider adding in exercise. Exercise, particularly resistance training, prevents something called the <strong>down-regulation of metabolism.<\/strong> This is where your metabolism slows down in response to eating a lower caloric intake. Although our clients that weigh over 200 lbs and have a lot more weight to lose <strong>often skip this part and increase their daily walks instead.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>DAYS 14-21: Carb Cycling<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of this week should be to test <strong>introducing very, very low amounts of carbohydrates<\/strong> and seeing how your body responds. This can be tricky&nbsp;though because many of our clients that weigh over 200 lbs often find that they need to <strong>remain without carbs for longer due to weight loss slowing or stalling.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Master these things for 21 Days, and you WILL lose lots of weight \u2013 and FAST!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there are still quite a few questions that you probably have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>What are the best sources of protein, fats, and carbohydrates?
