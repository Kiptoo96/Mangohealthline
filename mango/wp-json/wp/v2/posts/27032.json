And these benefits of yoga are just the beginning!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga can transform your body and your mind through regular practice, and that\u2019s true for people of all skill levels. It doesn\u2019t take an expert yogi to reap the benefits of daily exercise and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-poses-beginners-relaxation\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">relaxation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The longer you commit to yoga, the more <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/benefits-of-yoga\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">health benefits<\/a> you\u2019ll notice. Lowered blood pressure, improved lung capacity, and improved sexual function are a few notable items on the list of perks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yoga may also help <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/relieve-aches-pains-yoga\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">relieve pain<\/a> in certain muscle groups, as well as ease anxiety and improve balance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven\u2019t yet embraced yoga and all its benefits, try our 10-minute morning yoga routine to ease into daily practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting the morning with a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/full-body-yoga-workout-home\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yoga workout<\/a> can help you feel relaxed and ready for your day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.

Keep the pose for anywhere from three to five minutes for the best result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.doyou.com\/5-health-benefits-of-childs-pose\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Do You Yoga<\/a>, there are <strong>five main benefits<\/strong> of the Child\u2019s Pose for active yogis. Part of the relaxing and calming effect is due to placing your head down on the mat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another benefit is the position\u2019s ability to <strong>aid digestion<\/strong>. The nature of the scrunched-up pose means that your stomach is resting on your thighs, applying pressure in an almost massaging way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The position also helps <strong>stretch your back<\/strong>, the perfect introduction to your day if you\u2019ll be sitting at a desk for much of it. Similarly, the stretch opens up your hips, another victim of desk sitting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, because it\u2019s a resting position, Child\u2019s Pose is an <strong>easy start for your workout,<\/strong> waking you up without making you wish you could crawl back into bed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[Make sure you do child&#8217;s pose at the end of your workout as well or between any more difficult poses when your body needs a rest.]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.

Avoiding injury by <strong>keeping your core engaged<\/strong> keeps you from collapsing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video below illustrates proper form for both beginners and intermediate yogis. Anyone who has tried the pose knows that <strong>it\u2019s deceptively simple by appearance, but not so in practice (as many <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-asanas-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yoga asanas<\/a> are).<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.

This serves to loosen up your hamstrings and help stretch your back at the same time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a helpful exercise for any body type, but particularly for athletes who deal with sore or tight hamstrings. <strong>It also aids in digestion, plus relieving stress and calming your brain<\/strong>, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.active.com\/health\/articles\/pose-of-the-month-standing-forward-bend-872757\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Active<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other helpful benefits include reducing mild depression and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/12-minute-yoga-workout-calm-stress-anxiety\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reducing anxiety<\/a> since the pose helps you connect with your body and balance yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bend your knees slightly and place your chest and belly on your thighs.
