The key is to make your practice just that &#8211; <em>YOURS.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve taken the plunge and decided to start a practice, kudos to you! <strong>You\u2019re going to love the way you feel <\/strong>after you\u2019ve been doing it for a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are some tips to start your new yoga practice safely and to help you stick with it<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. It\u2019s How You Do It, Not How Much or How Often<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Exercise is important at any age because it keeps us fit and healthy.<\/strong> Yoga can help us do that, but it doesn\u2019t have to be about how often you go or if your heels touch the mat during Downward Dog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of us have spent years in torturously high heels, shortening our calf muscles to the point that it\u2019s a surprise when our heels touch the ground when we\u2019re simply walking! Sometimes they never quite get there, no matter how long we practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The true benefits of yoga lie in <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/yogainternational.com\/article\/view\/tips-for-teaching-yogis-over-60\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>connecting<\/strong><\/a><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/yogainternational.com\/article\/view\/tips-for-teaching-yogis-over-60\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> with ourselves<\/a> on many levels<\/strong>, not just the physical. We can bring mindfulness and present moment into our practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The quality of time we spend on the mat is way more important than how much time<\/strong>, or how long we hold a pose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing awareness to the tightness in a muscle while we stretch and exploring why we might be holding tension there, can have a lot to do with how our practice evolves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Find the Right Studio and Teacher<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/yoga-for-women-over-60-min.jpg\" alt=\"yoga tips for women over 60 include finding the right studio and classes\" class=\"wp-image-27531\" title=\"yoga tips for women over 60 include finding the right studio and classes\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/yoga-for-women-over-60-min.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/yoga-for-women-over-60-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/yoga-for-women-over-60-min-365x243.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/yoga-for-women-over-60-min-355x236.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t walk through Whole Foods without running into at least one yoga teacher in every aisle. There are almost as many types of yoga classes to choose from!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most yoga studios offer <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gaia.com\/article\/go-softly-benefits-gentle-yoga\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>gentle yoga<\/strong><\/a><strong> and senior classes<\/strong>. They\u2019re usually taught by instructors that have experience with people who have special physical needs or seniors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in great shape and you feel like you can do a regular yoga class, then go for it! <strong>It might be helpful, though, to start with a class that\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-asanas-older-women\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">geared toward seniors<\/a><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-asanas-older-women\/\">,<\/a> then as you get comfortable, move into a regular class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many seniors should take extra precautions because of issues like decreased bone density, balance problems, high blood pressure, low flexibility, and poor circulation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>They often use props like <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2z7Kate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">blocks<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gG9hfL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">straps<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gFcKeq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">pillows<\/a><\/strong> to help an otherwise inflexible limb get where it needs to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Go Easy on Yourself<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a fact that when we get older, our bodies don\u2019t bounce back like they used to. It\u2019s also human nature to get super excited about starting something new and going at it with serious gusto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We often end up regretting this when we realized that we jumped in too quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When we get older, our bodies need a lot more love than they used to<\/strong>. We aren\u2019t as <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-poses-for-flexibility\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stretchy and bendy<\/a> as when we were younger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also tend to lose muscle strength, bone density, and the ability to regenerate tissue quickly. If we get injured, we go down for the count much longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t sabotage your new practice by going too hard, too fast, too quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give your body time to get comfortable with the basic poses and to build up strength in muscles you probably haven\u2019t used in a long time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Take it easy and go at your own pace.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.
