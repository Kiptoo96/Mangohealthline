Don&#8217;t worry about exercise (right now).<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be thinking: &nbsp;<em>What???? No Way!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s capital-T True.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The thing is, diet&nbsp;has SO MUCH MORE&nbsp;to do with weight loss and especially <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/fastest-way-to-lose-weight-in-3-weeks\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fast weight loss<\/a> like this.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of reasons that I&nbsp;don\u2019t recommend exercise when cutting down weight fast for a short period of time or if you\u2019re significantly overweight:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Diet plays the majority role in weight loss success, not exercise.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The diet plan below recommends cutting out carbohydrates. &nbsp;This will significantly reduce glycogen levels in the bloodstream, making a workout very difficult from lack of energy. &nbsp;Being a trainer who has watched someone pass out running on a treadmill while on a low carb diet, it\u2019s not something I can recommend (wasn\u2019t my client!).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It allows one to focus willpower reserves on a diet and sticking to the plan.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Intense exercise depletes glycogen, which causes cravings. &nbsp;This is not good when eating a strict diet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of doing intense exercise or crazy cardio workouts\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Go on daily walks or do some yoga!<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight.jpg\" alt=\"daily walk to lose weight\" class=\"wp-image-7088\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Both of these exercises will get the heart pumping and muscles working, without the depletion of glycogen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these exercises will help the body lose weight, and you will still feel good about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Bring salt down to 1500mg \u2013 2300mg per day.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s wayyyyyy to much salt in the average diet. The problem is that salt causes bloating and water retention, particularly in the face and around the stubborn stomach region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do NOT cut salt of the diet, just bring it down to a normal number.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Eliminate potential allergic foods.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being allergic to something does not mean that you have an immediate sharp reaction to it. &nbsp;Mild allergies often go unnoticed, and lots of people have them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This happens all the time with what we eat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, the food may cause a few minor problems (a little gas or <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/how-to-reduce-belly-bloat-and-keep-it-off\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bloating<\/a>), but it\u2019s really not enough to notice unless you\u2019re hyper-focused on the issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if trying to lose weight fast, these foods can slow the weight loss process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eliminate all potentially allergic foods like dairy, gluten, and others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Eat an enormous amount of low carb veggies.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Vegetables-Resized.png\" alt=\"chopped vegetables on a cutting board\" class=\"wp-image-31161\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Vegetables-Resized.png 660w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Vegetables-Resized-300x193.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>When losing weight, it\u2019s not always about what you take away that matters, it\u2019s also about what you ADD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low carb veggies are the best way to get lots of <strong>fiber and micronutrients<\/strong> the body CRAVES. &nbsp;This will help to curb hunger cravings and help the fat \u201cexit\u201d out of the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eat lots of them. &nbsp;Just make sure they are low carb because foods&nbsp;like potatoes and corn will slow weight loss results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Detox from carbs.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order for fat-burning potential to be high, insulin has to be down. &nbsp;This is just how the body works and why so many people can\u2019t lose weight even while cutting calories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their bodies have become <strong>insulin resistant<\/strong> and refuse to lose the weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Detox from carbohydrates (detoxing is a fancy word that just means <strong>eliminate<\/strong>) for the entire week. &nbsp;You can eat some again the night before your big event to fill out your muscles and figure.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7.
