The fatal drug Fen-Phen, which was a cocktail of phentermine combined with fenfluramine, was taken off the market quickly due to the deaths and injuries it caused.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People have been using it for a long time, though, so there are plenty of studies done about its safety and effectiveness. The primary issue with <strong>taking a phentermine brand that\u2019s been combined with another drug<\/strong> is the lack of testing done on the cocktail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drug companies get excited about how quickly the drug combos work and don\u2019t always practice safety first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Does Phentermine Work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s an amphetamine substitute, so it causes the release of a bunch of chemicals that <strong>make you feel more energetic.<\/strong> It also stimulates the release of happy helpers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/thai-nguyen\/hacking-into-your-happy-c_b_6007660.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">serotonin and dopamine<\/a>, which chill you out, so you don\u2019t feel like you had 27 cups of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.livestrong.com\/article\/527849-why-does-caffeine-cause-the-jitters\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coffee<\/a> after taking it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, though. It <strong>causes adrenaline to release<\/strong>, which makes <a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/fat-burning-foods\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fat cells burn faster<\/a>, so you\u2019ll feel it a little. It just doesn\u2019t make most people jittery like many other stimulants do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way that phentermine helps you lose weight is that you eat less. <strong>It tricks your body into thinking you\u2019ve already eaten, so you don\u2019t eat as often, and you feel fuller when you do.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies show that because participants didn\u2019t want to eat very often while they were on it, their food cravings went way down.

It can give them a \u201cwin\u201d on the scale, which is an incentive for sticking with a diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though doctors steer clear of doling out diet pill prescriptions to people who aren\u2019t technically obese, they\u2019ll only prescribe them for a few months. Long-term studies on the risks of phentermine show that they increase the longer you take the drug.
