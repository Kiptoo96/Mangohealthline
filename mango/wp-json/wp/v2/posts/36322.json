You&#8217;re about to start strength training, often interchangeably referred to as resistance training or weight lifting.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, before we proceed, let&#8217;s clear up any apprehension about this term. Strength training doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re aiming to be bodybuilders (unless you want to, of course!), but rather we&#8217;re seeking a way to enhance our overall health, physical strength, and well-being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strength training is a versatile form of exercise designed to improve muscular fitness by exercising a muscle or muscle group against external resistance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, you&#8217;re teaching your muscles to work harder than they usually do, thereby increasing their strength and endurance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of strength training lies in its flexibility\u2014no need to invest in expensive gym memberships or high-tech equipment. It can involve a range of equipment or none at all!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use your own body weight (think push-ups, squats, or lunges), or add external equipment like dumbbells, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/beginner-kettlebell-exercises-for-women\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27580\">kettlebells<\/a>, and resistance bands to your routine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No dumbbells at hand? No problem. A couple of soup cans or water bottles can also serve as excellent beginner weights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why, you ask, should we, the proud carriers of the XX chromosome, make strength training a regular part of our fitness routine? Here are the compelling reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Muscular Strength and Endurance&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular strength training helps increase muscle strength and endurance, making everyday activities easier.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-carrying-groceries-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Strength Training for Women carrying groceries\" class=\"wp-image-36335\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-carrying-groceries-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-carrying-groceries-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-carrying-groceries-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-carrying-groceries-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-carrying-groceries.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s lugging groceries up the stairs, rearranging your living room furniture, or playing with your kids or grandkids, strength training makes it all more manageable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Boost Metabolism and Weight Management&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike some beliefs, strength training won&#8217;t make you &#8220;bulky.&#8221; Instead, it helps increase lean muscle mass, which, in turn, can boost your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/metabolic-id-weight-loss\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"30142\">metabolism<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means you&#8217;ll be burning more calories even at rest.

It builds not just muscle, but confidence and self-esteem too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you can lift heavier weights than you could a few weeks ago, there\u2019s an immense sense of achievement and self-pride that comes with it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a clear sign of progress that your hard work is paying off. And who doesn&#8217;t like the sound of &#8220;I did it!&#8221; echoing in their minds after a challenging workout?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the empowerment doesn&#8217;t stop at the gym doors.

Strength Training for Women<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s where the fun begins, ladies! Before you get started, remember, strength training is not about transforming into the Hulk (unless that&#8217;s your goal &#8211; you do you!). It&#8217;s about getting stronger, fitter, and embracing your amazing self.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Start Slow<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-start-slow-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Strength Training for Women start slow\" class=\"wp-image-36342\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-start-slow-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-start-slow-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-start-slow-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-start-slow-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-start-slow.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The wonderful thing about beginning any journey, including strength training, is that you set the pace. It&#8217;s not a race, and there are no shortcuts to reaching your fitness goals. Therefore, one crucial piece of advice for those new to the world of strength training is this: Start slow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like mastering any skill, strength training requires a learning curve, a period of adaptation where your body becomes accustomed to new movements and challenges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You wouldn&#8217;t expect to play a Beethoven symphony the first time you sit at a piano, right? Similarly, don&#8217;t expect to lift heavy weights or execute complex exercises right off the bat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Embrace Bodyweight Exercises:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best starting point? Your own body! Bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups are excellent introductions to strength training. They help build foundational strength and teach you proper form\u2014two essential elements that will help prevent injuries as you progress to more challenging exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, bodyweight exercises are highly versatile and can be modified to suit your fitness level. For instance, if a regular push-up feels too challenging at first, you can start with wall or knee push-ups and gradually work your way up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Gradually Introduce Weights:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;re comfortable with bodyweight exercises and feel ready to up the ante, you can gradually introduce weights into your routine. However, remember that &#8216;gradual&#8217; is the keyword here. Start with lighter weights that you can lift comfortably for about 12-15 reps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t have dumbbells at home? No problem! You can get creative with what you have around the house. Soup cans, water bottles, or even laundry detergent bottles can serve as makeshift weights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Form is Key<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as the rhythm is to a dance, so is form to strength training\u2014it sets the tone, maintains balance, and ensures the right moves. Let&#8217;s say it loud and clear: Form is paramount!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it so important? Well, correct form is what ensures that you&#8217;re effectively working the right muscle groups without risking injury. It&#8217;s the quality-over-quantity principle in action\u2014doing fewer repetitions (reps) with correct form is far more beneficial than doing more reps with poor form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do you make sure you&#8217;re maintaining the right form? Here are some ways:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Get Educated:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-eductiona-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Strength Training for Women eductiona\" class=\"wp-image-36337\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-eductiona-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-eductiona-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-eductiona-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-eductiona-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-eductiona.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first steps towards maintaining correct form is to understand how an exercise is supposed to be performed. You can do this by watching online workout videos, reading fitness blogs, or using fitness apps that provide step-by-step guidance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These resources often provide visual demonstrations and detailed instructions on proper exercise techniques.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Hire a Trainer:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re new to strength training, it may be beneficial to work with a personal trainer, at least in the initial stages. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trainers can observe your movements and provide instant feedback, correcting your form in real time. They can also help you modify exercises to suit your fitness level and address any specific concerns you might have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Mind-Muscle Connection:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a technique where you focus your attention on the muscle you&#8217;re working on. For instance, if you&#8217;re doing a squat, you should be thinking about your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/web-stories\/6-butt-exercises-for-a-booty-pump\/\" data-type=\"web-story\" data-id=\"33265\">glutes and thighs<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of focused attention helps ensure that you&#8217;re engaging the right muscles and maintaining proper form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Practice Makes Perfect:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as with any skill, practice is key when it comes to maintaining correct form. Start with lighter weights or bodyweight exercises, and take your time with each rep, ensuring you&#8217;ve got the form down before you add more weight or increase intensity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, our ultimate aim with strength training is to gain strength and improve health\u2014not end up with sprains, strains, or worse. Correct form helps protect your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/strength-training-for-weight-loss-and-body-composition\/\">body and ensures that your strength training<\/a> journey is beneficial, safe, and effective.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mix It Up<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-mix-it-up-and-have-fun.jpg\" alt=\"Strength Training for Women mix it up and have fun\" class=\"wp-image-36339\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Variety, they say, is the spice of life. And when it comes to strength training, variety is not just the spice, but the secret sauce of an effective, enjoyable, and balanced workout routine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is mixing up your routine so important?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, it helps work out different muscle groups, ensuring that your body gains strength evenly. Additionally, changing up your routine helps prevent workout boredom and keeps things exciting. Who said workouts couldn&#8217;t be fun, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few strategies for keeping things fresh in your strength training journey:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Play with Different Exercises:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a whole universe of exercises out there\u2014why limit yourself to just a handful? Explore different exercises that target various muscle groups.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been doing squats and lunges for your lower body, for instance, try incorporating step-ups or deadlifts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Been doing a lot of bicep curls? Mix in some <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/flabby-arms\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"29892\">tricep dips<\/a> or overhead presses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Try New Equipment:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-be-creative-balls-and-dumbbells-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Strength Training for Women be creative balls and dumbbells\" class=\"wp-image-36334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-be-creative-balls-and-dumbbells-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-be-creative-balls-and-dumbbells-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-be-creative-balls-and-dumbbells-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-be-creative-balls-and-dumbbells-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-be-creative-balls-and-dumbbells.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While there&#8217;s plenty you can do with just dumbbells or your bodyweight, trying out new equipment can add an extra layer of fun and challenge to your workouts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Resistance bands, kettlebells, medicine balls, and barbells each offer unique benefits and can be used for a variety of exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Experiment with Workout Styles:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strength training isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all deal. There are several styles you can experiment with, from traditional weight lifting to circuit training, functional fitness, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/web-stories\/nitric-oxide-dump-exercise\/\" data-type=\"web-story\" data-id=\"35358\">HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)<\/a>, and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each brings something different to the table, keeping your workouts dynamic and engaging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Challenge Yourself:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve mastered a particular weight or can comfortably complete a set of exercises, don&#8217;t be afraid to challenge yourself. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might mean adding more weight, increasing the number of repetitions, or decreasing the rest time between sets. Remember, strength training is all about gradual progression!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Be Creative:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, remember that your workouts are yours to design. Feel free to get creative and mix and match different exercises to create a routine that you enjoy and that meets your unique fitness goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By adding variety to your strength training routine, you&#8217;ll not only make your workouts more balanced and effective but also more enjoyable. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, part of the fun of strength training is the journey itself\u2014exploring new exercises, pushing your limits, and discovering just how strong you can become.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rest and Recover<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In our eagerness to build strength, it&#8217;s easy to overlook an essential part of the fitness equation\u2014rest and recovery.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of your strength training routine like a two-step dance. The first step involves challenging your body with tough workouts, and the second step, equally important, is giving your body the rest it needs to rebuild and come back stronger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to ace your recovery game:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Sleep Like a Champion:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep is when the magic happens. It&#8217;s during those precious hours of shut-eye that your body gets to work repairing and rebuilding your muscles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deep sleep triggers the release of growth hormones, which are crucial for muscle recovery and growth. So, make sure you&#8217;re clocking in 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night\u2014your muscles will thank you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Fuel Your Recovery:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-protein-shake-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Strength Training for Women protein shake\" class=\"wp-image-36341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-protein-shake-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-protein-shake-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-protein-shake-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-protein-shake-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-protein-shake.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The foods you eat play a pivotal role in muscle recovery. <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/10-yummy-high-protein-low-carb-snacks\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8273\">Protein<\/a>, in particular, is essential\u2014it&#8217;s the building block your body uses to repair and grow muscle tissue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure you&#8217;re consuming enough protein throughout the day, particularly after your workout, when muscle protein synthesis is at its peak.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Embrace Rest Days:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might seem counterintuitive, but taking regular breaks from intense workouts is beneficial for your strength training progress.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rest days give your muscles a chance to repair, adapt, and grow stronger. Aim to have at least one rest day between intense workouts, and remember that a rest day doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean doing nothing\u2014you can engage in light activities like walking, stretching, or yoga.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Water is crucial for every cellular process in your body, including muscle recovery.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/drinking-water-lose-weight\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8360\">well-hydrated<\/a> before, during, and after your workouts to support your body&#8217;s natural healing processes and maintain optimal performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Listen to Your Body:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all, learn to listen to your body. If you&#8217;re feeling excessively sore or fatigued, it might be a sign that you need extra recovery time. Remember, it&#8217;s better to take an extra rest day now than to risk injury or burnout down the line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By adopting a well-rounded recovery strategy, you&#8217;re not just supporting your body&#8217;s healing process, but also setting the stage for sustained progress in your strength training journey. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the best part? You get to kick back and relax, secure in the knowledge that you&#8217;re still making gains.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Just Do It!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Strength-Training-for-Women-trainer.jpg\" alt=\"Strength Training for Women trainer\" class=\"wp-image-36343\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is often the hardest. But guess what? You&#8217;ve got this, and we&#8217;re rooting for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join a gym, hire a trainer, or start at home. There&#8217;s no perfect place or time. The perfect time is now. The perfect place is here.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get your favorite playlist, put on your workout gear (extra points for <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3oIIWEd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">pink dumbbells!<\/a>), and start lifting. Your stronger, fitter, empowered self is waiting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, every strong woman started just like you, a bit unsure but with the resolve to try.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Celebrate every small victory, every extra rep, every new muscle definition. Strength training is not just a journey towards physical strength, but a journey of self-discovery and self-love.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be strong, be fierce, be you!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"668\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/strength-training-for-women-4-668x1024.jpg\" alt=\"strength training for women (4)\" class=\"wp-image-36329\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/strength-training-for-women-4-668x1024.jpg 668w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/strength-training-for-women-4-196x300.jpg 196w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/strength-training-for-women-4-768x1178.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/strength-training-for-women-4-1002x1536.jpg 1002w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/strength-training-for-women-4-1336x2048.jpg 1336w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/strength-training-for-women-4-150x230.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/strength-training-for-women-4.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Did you know?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/programs.avocadu.com\/p\/21-day-fat-loss-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a> includes a great workout plan, which is optional, but quite effective! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lose weight AND build strength for the optimal, healthy YOU.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/programs.avocadu.com\/p\/21-day-fat-loss-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"240\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-1024x240.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36179\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-1024x240.png 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-300x70.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-768x180.png 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-1536x359.png 1536w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min-150x35.png 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/21-DAY-FULL-BUNDLE-min.png 1932w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hello, all you superwomen out there!
