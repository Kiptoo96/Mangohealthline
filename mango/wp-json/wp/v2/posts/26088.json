Avoid Alcohol.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I know&#8230;<\/em> It&#8217;s tough to hear. I love my wine just as much as the next person (or a lot more).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/avoid-alcohol-for-the-fastest-way-to-lose-weight.jpg\" alt=\"avoid alcohol for the fastest way to lose weight in 3 weeks\" class=\"wp-image-26414\" title=\"avoid alcohol for the fastest way to lose weight in 3 weeks\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/avoid-alcohol-for-the-fastest-way-to-lose-weight.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/avoid-alcohol-for-the-fastest-way-to-lose-weight-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/avoid-alcohol-for-the-fastest-way-to-lose-weight-365x244.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/avoid-alcohol-for-the-fastest-way-to-lose-weight-355x237.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, your glass of wine has some antioxidants. Beer has some health benefits, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/food-recipes\/features\/truth-about-beer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WebMD<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the bottom line is this: <strong>Any trace nutrients or benefits you may get from alcoholic beverages can ALWAYS be found through higher-quality sources.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I promise you that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, no matter what type of alcohol you drink, it\u2019s filled with empty calories. There are about 90 to 200 calories in the average glass of wine or beer. A few of those a night can add more calories than a doughnut to your daily calorie count.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been drinking moderately (or heavily\u2014we won\u2019t judge), <strong>limiting alcohol can be a quick way to cut those calories without feeling hungry.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, alcohol consumption can damage the liver and the pancreas (<a href=\"https:\/\/pubs.niaaa.nih.gov\/publications\/Hangovers\/beyondHangovers.htm#chapter04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These organs are crucial for optimal digestion of food, and they help the body convert nutrients into energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keeping the liver and the pancreas healthy can help make sure that the food that you eat is going where it\u2019s supposed to.<\/strong> It can also allow your body to regulate blood sugar adequately. Out-of-control blood sugar can lead to cravings and weight gain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, your body burns close to 75% less fat by the time you\u2019ve downed half of your second alcoholic beverage, according to this study (<a href=\"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/70\/5\/928.long\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also uses fewer carbs for energy because it wants to use the toxic by-products created as a result of alcohol consumption instead. You end up being more likely to store those extra carbs as fat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Eat Cleaner than You\u2019ve Ever Eaten Before.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re sensitive to a particular food ingredient, you might be unaware that it\u2019s causing inflammation.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although sugar, simple carbohydrates, dairy and highly processed foods are likely culprits, you could also be sensitive to something random, like salicylates or nightshades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you tend to eat a particular food regularly, try avoiding it for a few weeks just to see if something shifts. You may notice that you instantly lose the bloat or stop getting gassy in the afternoons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Focusing on eating only fresh foods that you prepare yourself can also help you lose weight quickly.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/protein-and-veggie-detox-for-21-day-diet-challenge-200-lbs.jpg\" alt=\"eating fresh foods is the fastest way to lose weight in 3 weeks\" class=\"wp-image-25977\" title=\"eating fresh foods is the fastest way to lose weight in 3 weeks\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/protein-and-veggie-detox-for-21-day-diet-challenge-200-lbs.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/protein-and-veggie-detox-for-21-day-diet-challenge-200-lbs-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/protein-and-veggie-detox-for-21-day-diet-challenge-200-lbs-365x242.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/protein-and-veggie-detox-for-21-day-diet-challenge-200-lbs-355x236.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Processed foods contain a lot of sodium and sugars, and they often have chemicals that mess with your body\u2019s ability to function optimally.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Detoxifying your body of these chemicals will make it react better to the clean nutrients that you take in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.
