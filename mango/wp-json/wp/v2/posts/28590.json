The problem might be that you\u2019re taking in too many calories and not burning them off fast enough to lose weight. A weight loss calculator can help you better identify the problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calories are units of energy that we consume whenever we eat. We also use them as fuel to get us through the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The general rule is that<strong> to lose weight, you must burn more calories than you ingest<\/strong>, which is a little more complex than it sounds. There are multiple factors to take into consideration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight loss counters are a great way to keep yourself on track with your goals, but there are a lot to choose from. Sometimes they aren\u2019t very accurate because they don\u2019t include all the variables needed to tell you how many calories you should eat to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Science Behind Weight Loss Calculators<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight loss calculators are usually based on a mathematical formula called the Mifflin St. Jeor equation, which calculates the number of calories your body needs to function. (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalrph.com\/resting_metabolic_rate.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>) This is called the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellfit.com\/metabolism-facts-101-3495605\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">basal metabolic rate<\/a>, or BMR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most calculators are based on weight, height, gender, and age<\/strong>, then they factor in lifestyle information and how much you exercise. This is where the numbers differ and what makes some weight loss calculators better than others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have two guys that are the same weight, age, and height, their calories needed to lose weight might be vastly different because of how active they are. One guy might park his booty <a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/exercise-to-do-at-your-desk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in front of the computer<\/a> all day playing RPGs, while the other is standing in front of a group of students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An accurate calculator will use the BMR, and also calculate your <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/healthyeater.com\/important-tool-weight-loss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)<\/strong><\/a>. It will include whether you are a workout monster or just dabble, and your general activity level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important not to get too obsessed with counting calories, though. There are a lot of other things to consider when embarking on your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-100-pounds-simple-diet\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weight loss journey<\/a>, and <strong>you don\u2019t want to get obsessed. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of studies out there that show that stressing out over what you eat can make your body put on the pounds (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.prevention.com\/weight-loss\/what-happens-when-you-stop-counting-calories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4 Most Accurate Weight Loss Calculators<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. <\/strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.niddk.nih.gov\/health-information\/weight-management\/body-weight-planner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>NIH Body Weight Planner<\/strong><\/a><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s not to like about using the same calculator that scientists at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nih.gov\/news-events\/news-releases\/nih-research-model-predicts-weight-varying-diet-exercise-changes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Institute of Health<\/a> use for their research?
