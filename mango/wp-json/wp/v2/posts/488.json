We&#8217;ll give you a couple of cucumber water recipes to try to at the end!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S. A tall glass of refreshing cucumber water is easy to make and has some surprising health benefits and will give you some added vitamins and minerals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are all of the health benefits from drinking cucumber water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Supports Healthy Skin<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cucumbers provide a variety of nutrients, but one in particular called Silica is especially supportive of skin health (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5678890\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This nutrient helps the skin by<strong> improving hydration and elasticity<\/strong>. On top of that, drinking water, in general, is key to keeping the skin hydrated and healthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After&nbsp;drinking&nbsp;the water, the cucumbers can also be used topically by rubbing them on blemishes or putting them on the&nbsp;eyes as part of a face mask. &nbsp;They can also be eaten!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Hydrating<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of hydration&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hydration helps with skin elasticity, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fAjdI7J4Gvo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lowering stress<\/a><\/span>, regularity, and boosting energy<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cucumber water also makes water taste better, which makes it more likely that you&#8217;ll drink it and choose it over other less healthy options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to drink&nbsp;filtered and purified water to avoid the contaminants in tap water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Contains Cancer-Fighting Nutrients<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cucumbers contain cucurbitacins (a type of phytonutrient), which have shown promise in treating cancer in a recent study performed by the&nbsp;<em>Internal Journal of Health Sciences <\/em>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23559908\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/shutterstock_209295178-e1600703319283.jpg\" alt=\"Cucumber on the Vine\" class=\"wp-image-1735\" title=\"Cucumber on the Vine\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>These nutrients are not powerful enough to stop cancer on their own but should be used as a&nbsp;supplement to a healthy diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When the body is&nbsp;taking in vitamins, minerals, and nutrients like cucurbitacins, there&#8217;s a&nbsp;much better chance it will stay&nbsp;healthy in the long-term.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to take cucumber water on the go, check out this <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B014K1OSN4\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B014K1OSN4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=h30-20&amp;linkId=YOMQQYEHVHLKMY3V\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">BPA-FREE infuser water bottle<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Aids Weight Loss<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cucumber water helps quench thirst and keeps the body from mindlessly craving sugary drinks that are high in calories. This is an easy way to effortlessly cut calories out of the diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cucumber is also a mild diuretic, which will help with bloat and flush out excess water weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the additional water in the diet will help remove <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/top-10-reasons-to-detoxify-your-body\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">harmful toxins<\/a><\/span> from the body and promote optimal nutrient uptake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5.

Cucumbers&nbsp;also do not contain any sodium, meaning that they&nbsp;help increase control of the body&#8217;s blood pressure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The body needs hydration and potassium to help keep blood sugar down, and cucumber water is an excellent source for both of these.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Contains Anti-aging Nutrients<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cucumbers contain numerous flavonoid antioxidants, including quercetin, apigenin, luteolin, and kaempfero.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also have other phytonutrients like&nbsp;lignans that have powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These nutrients prevent free radicals from building up in the body and keep the body&nbsp;from prematurely aging. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foods like cucumbers help to ensure aging in a graceful and more natural way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7.
