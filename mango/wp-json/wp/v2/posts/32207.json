She shares some great tips and information for anyone interested in improving their health and losing weight.]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have learned over time and from experience, the dramatic effects coffee has on my body.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I couldn\u2019t live without coffee in college; I loved everything about it, the taste, smell, and energy it produced.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I began to pay attention to how my body was feeling and responding to my caffeine intake.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always wondered why I would get jittery, nauseous, or become exhausted later in the day and find myself searching for more caffeine. This was my body\u2019s way of telling me: \u201cHEY! There\u2019s a problem here!\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never even realized how much of a problem there was with my caffeine consumption until college. During one of my courses, I was performing an exercise test to monitor my heart rhythm, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My professor, at the time, asks me: \u201cDid you know you have an irregular heartbeat?\u201d Confused and unaware of my irregular heartbeat, I later found out it was due to my caffeine consumption.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That is the moment when the problem became real to me.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only was I creating my problem by consuming an excessive amount of coffee, but I was also contributing to it by additionally drinking pre-workout and energy drinks &#8211; I mean, it\u2019s no wonder why my heart wasn\u2019t functioning correctly!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until a few years later that I learned about mushroom coffee and began implementing it into my diet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can honestly say that it was by far one of the most significant changes I\u2019ve made. My body operates more efficiently, and I never have any jitters or sugary crashes throughout the day anymore.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also sleep much better and feel well-rested, not to mention that overall, I have more energy throughout the day than when I would consume caffeine from coffee and other sources!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, <em>all<\/em> the money I <strong>SAVE<\/strong> on Starbucks\u2026 You can\u2019t beat that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Coffee and Caffeine<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Coffee-and-Caffeine-min.png\" alt=\"Model of caffeine molecule next to coffee beans in Petri dish on a white background\" class=\"wp-image-32209\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Coffee-and-Caffeine-min.png 660w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Coffee-and-Caffeine-min-300x193.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Coffee-and-Caffeine-min-20x13.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>What better way to start the day than with a cup of fresh coffee, right? Ahhh, I can smell it brewing, just like the vast majority of the world, every morning, afternoon, and evening.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no wonder our bodies can\u2019t fully rest!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there\u2019s one thing I have learned, it&#8217;s that food, in this case caffeine, is very <em>bio-individual<\/em>, which means that some people&#8217;s bodies can handle more caffeine than others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average American consumes 3 \u00bd cups (28 oz) of coffee per day! That is the equivalent of 336 milligrams of caffeine a day from coffee alone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/canvas-latest.edvera.com\/account_3\/attachments\/76713\/The%20Highs%20and%20Lows%20of%20Caffeine%20Consumption_July18.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Institute of Integrative Nutrition<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/nutrition-and-healthy-eating\/in-depth\/caffeine\/art-20045678\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MayoClinic<\/a>, an average of 400 mg of caffeine per day is acceptable for a healthy adult; however, once 500-600 mg of caffeine is consumed, adverse side effects may occur.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, every individual\u2019s response to caffeine is unique and will differ from person to person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How much caffeine do you consume daily?&nbsp;<\/li><li>Is that amount of caffeine&nbsp; working for you?&nbsp;<\/li><li>Are you able to sleep at night?&nbsp;<\/li><li>Do you ever feel anxious?&nbsp;<\/li><li>How about exhaustion; ever get that drowsy feeling throughout your day?&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Coffee contains phytonutrients that help stabilize free radicals in the body, prevent tumor growth, assimilate vitamin C, and provide a small amount of magnesium, potassium, and niacin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consuming some caffeine in the diet can also improve athletic performance and increase focus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are many benefits of coffee itself, like anything else, when caffeine is consumed in excessive amounts, it may cause the user to also experience the negative side effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caffeine pumps adrenaline into the body, activating the adrenal glands in a way they naturally wouldn\u2019t operate and eventually resulting in adrenal exhaustion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this excess amount of caffeine is absorbed into the body, it may lead to a slight reduction in bone density and increase:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Anxiety<\/li><li>Irritability<\/li><li>Jitteriness<\/li><li>Nausea<\/li><li>Insomnia<\/li><li>Gastrointestinal Distress<\/li><li>Rapid Heartbeat<\/li><li>Risk of Coronary Heart Disease<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simply put, our bodies were not designed to operate on overdrive for 60 hours a week.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By stimulating the adrenals, caffeine increases a person&#8217;s heart rate and, at the same time, can increase a person&#8217;s exhaustion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you combine excessive amounts of caffeine with daily living stressors, caffeine consumption can lead to excessive cortisol production and initiate a stress response that increases cortisol release, which does not support the adrenals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the body&#8217;s cortisol levels are elevated, this can decrease insulin sensitivity and contribute to high blood glucose, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To support the adrenals, we must reduce our caffeine consumption.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is Mushroom Coffee?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div

blend).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Choose the Right Mushroom Coffee<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although mushrooms are a great alternative to reduce caffeine intake, to maximize the benefits of fungal products (including chaga, reishi, lions mane, cordyceps powders, etc.), mushrooms should be boiled at minimum for one to two hours, and even hour-long boiling only gets a partial extraction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downfall of mushroom coffee is that a minimal amount of the beneficial chemicals are extracted from dried mushrooms by merely steeping them in hot water for a few minutes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since <a href=\"https:\/\/mudwtr.com\/collections\/shop?rfsn=5790396.11692a&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=5790396.11692a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"rank-math-link\">mushroom coffee<\/a> products are only steeped for a few minutes, most beneficial chemicals remain in the powder and are not ingested by the consumer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way around the problem of partial mushroom extraction is to <strong>start with an extract and use it as an ingredient in the mushroom coffee.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means it is essential to pay close attention to the ingredients of products. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the product contains <strong>raw powders<\/strong> rather than extracts, they are <strong>primarily a placebo<\/strong> and confer little to no benefit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>more extracts<\/strong> used, the <strong>more beneficial<\/strong> the product is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Health Benefits of Mushrooms<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Functional mushrooms help fight and manage stress due to their adaptogenic properties, which support the adrenal glands and mitigate caffeine\u2019s jittery side effects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, mushrooms have various health benefits, containing antioxidants, prebiotics, and polysaccharides that support digestion, the immune system and contribute to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/foods-help-heal-leaky-gut\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"27343\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">healthy bacteria in the gut<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other compounds found in mushrooms serve as <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/probiotics-prebiotics-lose-weight-naturally\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8165\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">probiotics<\/a>, which allow the body to digest foods without extracting fats in the food and storing it as fat on the body.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some mushroom species also contain beta-glucans, a type of soluble dietary fiber essential to improve cholesterol, boost heart health, regulate blood sugar, and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/prevent-pre-diabetes-becoming-diabetes\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8099\"
