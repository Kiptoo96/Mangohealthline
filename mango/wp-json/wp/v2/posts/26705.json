The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists says that 27 million Americans have thyroid disease, and eight out of ten are women (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.aace.com\/files\/final-file-hypo-guidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the exact cause of the disease is unknown, pregnancy can be a contributing factor, and <strong>18 percent of women will have issues with their thyroid post-partum.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the Signs and Symptoms?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the symptoms of hypothyroidism can be hard to pinpoint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Because the hormones regulate so many major functions of the body, signs of the disease may be mild and far-reaching.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have hypothyroidism, you will likely experience one or more of the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fatigue or sleepiness<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mood swings<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Loss of memory<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight gain<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Depression and irritability<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Muscle cramping and aching<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Muscle weakness<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Decreased perspiration<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blood pressure changes<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>High cholesterol<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leg swelling<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blurred vision<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Intolerance to cold temperatures<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hoarse voice<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Heavy menses<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dry hair and skin<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hair loss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Constipation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a long list&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have the symptoms of hypothyroidism, <strong>the first step is to visit your doctor<\/strong>.&nbsp;

This can happen over time as the disease progresses, and will impact your metabolic set point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a healthy woman who weighs 170 pounds and is 5\u20196\u201d tall may be able to maintain your weight on 2500 calories daily.&nbsp; However, the same woman with hypothyroidism may have a significantly slower metabolism which means she will need to take in fewer calories to maintain her weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To counteract these effects, <strong>make <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/build-healthy-habits-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lifestyle changes<\/a> to boost your metabolism<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One great way to rev up your body\u2019s ability to burn calories is to <strong>add in <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/walking-to-lose-weight\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">daily exercise.&nbsp;

Limit your consumption of high-sugar and high-fat foods, and try to eliminate as many processed treats as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Second, manage your hunger and blood sugar levels by eating four to six smaller meals throughout the day<\/strong>.&nbsp;
