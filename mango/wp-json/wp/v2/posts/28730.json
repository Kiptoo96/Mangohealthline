There is no question that this is hands-down the best piece of equipment your butt needs!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got your&nbsp;band? Great! Let&#8217;s move on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What causes that booty &#8216;pump&#8217;?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That pump is a result of blood flow being directed to your working muscles&#8230; and in this case&#8230; <em>your butt!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many other ways to achieve that pump, one being through proper dieting and nutrition:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Drink enough water.<\/li><li>Eat enough carbs before you workout.<\/li><li>Eat potassium-rich foods like avocado, spinach, banana, dried apricots, sweet&nbsp;potato and coconut water.<\/li><li>Eat magnesium-rich&nbsp;foods like spinach, swiss&nbsp;chard, almonds, pumpkin seeds, dried figs, dark chocolate and banana.<\/li><li>Supplement with <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2LhiyfE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">creatine<\/a> (5g a day).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we have covered the recommended equipment and nutrition, let&#8217;s move on to some tips to help you get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tips Before Getting Started<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of training requires light to no weight, so <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2LlHLpd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">resistance bands<\/a> are perfect! Ideally, you want to <strong>maintain your form and perform the move as fast as possible<\/strong>&#8230; like a <em>pumping<\/em> action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you are going through the full range of motion and not cheating by moving too quickly and losing your form. Slow down if you feel that you might be compromising your form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re doing it right, you will<strong> feel a burn<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>in your glutes<\/strong> while performing these&#8230; and that&#8217;s a good thing! Keep pushing through it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These exercises will make your muscles feel sore while performing them and probably a little the following day, but you should recover quickly because they aren&#8217;t performed with heavy weights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exercise Instructions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Choose any two exercises below and set your timer for 3 minutes.<\/em><\/li><li><em>Perform 20-30 reps of each exercise before switching to the next one.<\/em><\/li><li><em>Alternate these two exercises for the full 3 minutes without taking breaks.<\/em><\/li><li><em>Repeat the steps above with the next two exercises and then another set with the last two exercises.<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Always, always, always keep your mind on <strong>actively engaging your glutes throughout the exercises.<\/strong> If you go through the motions without concentrating on flexing your glutes, you won&#8217;t get much out of these exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following butt exercises are brought to you [and performed by] our friend Ramona over at <a href=\"https:\/\/fitnizfury.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fitnizfury<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.
