Freshly ground ginger gives the peppy drink an edge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A teaspoon of natural sweetener enhances the flavor of the tea, but it isn\u2019t necessary to make the drink palatable. It might take some adjusting, but mixing the drink proves tastier than straight sips of ACV.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boosting your digestive system doesn\u2019t have to taste bad. Most taste testers report that the flavor of this drink is relatively mild, but adjust the ingredients to suit your preferences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.

Or, try ready-made kombucha at your local supermarket to see what flavors you like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While homemade kombucha is VERY good for you, it is quite a hassle to make. It might be easier to grab some pre-made from the store. Just make sure to watch out for sugar content. Look for a brand with 4g of sugar or less per serving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Parsley and Mint Detox Tea<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By now you know that your liver <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/top-10-reasons-to-detoxify-your-body\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">naturally detoxifies<\/a> your body on its own. That said, the promising studies surrounding detox teas show us that there\u2019s more to them than detoxification alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/parsley-detox-tea-recipe-min.jpg\" alt=\"parsley detox tea recipe\" class=\"wp-image-27090\" title=\"parsley detox tea recipe\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/parsley-detox-tea-recipe-min.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/parsley-detox-tea-recipe-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/parsley-detox-tea-recipe-min-365x243.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/parsley-detox-tea-recipe-min-355x236.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking certain medications, eating junk food, and experiencing stress can harm your liver. Helping it regenerate to optimum health requires proper nutrition and attention to self-care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/steptohealth.com\/detox-liver-amazing-parsley-mint-tea\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Step to Health\u2019s<\/a> tea recipe combines refreshing mint with freshly picked parsley, making the green veggie more than a garnish. Parsley contains flavonoids that help your body oxygenate itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has lots of vitamin C and vitamin A, two key nutrients for optimal liver function. They\u2019re also helpful for boosting your immune system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Parsley has diuretic properties too, so it helps to move things along in more ways than one. Mint aids digestion and stimulates liver function, especially when your liver becomes overloaded.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steep your freshly chopped parsley and mint in a cup of hot water.
