you understand how quickly your food will turn into glucose in your bloodstream, so you can choose your meals wisely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foods that have a <strong>high glycemic index<\/strong> are rapidly converted into glucose, <strong>which translates to a sudden spike in blood sugar.<\/strong> This means your body has to work harder to process the sudden dump of glucose in your system, which is exactly what you should avoid if you&#8217;re trying to reverse insulin resistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, you should look for foods with a <strong>low glycemic index<\/strong>, which are digested more slowly, <strong>releasing a slow, steady stream of glucose into your system.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to green veggies and fibrous fruits, foods that are high in protein or have whole grains are also usually low on the glycemic index.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The packaged, shelf-stable, processed foods in the inner aisles of the grocery store tend to have the highest glycemic index&#8211;<strong>so make sure to stay away from the rows, and shop the fresh, whole foods in the produce and refrigerated sections.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If in doubt, you can do a quick
