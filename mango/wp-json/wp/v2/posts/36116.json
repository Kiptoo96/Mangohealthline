This doesn\u2019t mean you need someone in your household or a close friend to lose weight with you, but you absolutely need support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need people in your corner cheering you on and rooting for you. If no one in your life is joining you on your weight loss journey, you need a group of people to turn to for support when it gets rough &#8211; and we\u2019re sorry to say, it will get rough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, <a href=\"https:\/\/programs.avocadu.com\/p\/21-day-fat-loss-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\">our program<\/a> understands the importance of support. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created a support group that is included with our fat loss challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This support group is available to every single person who participates because we are acutely aware of the fact how much easier it is to accomplish something when you don\u2019t feel alone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone should feel as though they can connect with a support group of like minded people trying to lose weight to promote support, motivation, and accountability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Related: Read our post, \u201c<\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-weight-faster-3-simple-science-approved-steps\/\"><strong><em>Lose Weight Faster: 3 Simple Science-Approved Steps<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em>\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2.

In general, tasks are easier to accomplish when you have set a plan in place to accomplish those tasks, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing weight is no different. You need structure to reach your goals and keep yourself on track. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trying to lose weight without a plan in place will likely leave you feeling frustrated and unsuccessful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it like your phone\u2019s GPS or even the paper maps of yesteryear. If you were trying to take a road trip to a new destination, you would likely need directions to get there. A road map can tell you the path you need to take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the program you choose, a detailed plan will help you get where you\u2019re trying to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/programs.avocadu.com\/p\/21-day-fat-loss-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\">Our program<\/a> offers a detailed, solid, and simple plan to help you lose weight.

Nutrition and diet are so important when it comes to weight loss, but you don\u2019t want to undereat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our bodies need nutrients and minerals to survive and it\u2019s incredibly important to ensure we\u2019re giving our bodies what they need. Eating too little will leave you feeling fatigued, unmotivated, and unhealthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many diets and programs out there will ask you to undereat to lose weight, but we don\u2019t. Sure, you could undereat for weeks on end and it may lead to weight loss, but you won\u2019t be healthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, under-eating will make you much more likely to binge and potentially quit. Bottom line &#8211; Safety should always be a top priority when losing weight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/programs.avocadu.com\/p\/21-day-fat-loss-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\">21 day weight loss challenge<\/a> program encourages you to eat enough to stay healthy while also promoting weight loss. We have done our research on nutrients and diet and have compiled a list of approved and non-approved foods for you. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key isn\u2019t to eat too little, the key is to eat less and ensure what we\u2019re eating covers the basis of our nutritional needs without stunting our weight loss.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Related: <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/weight-loss-stop-after-second-week\/\"><strong><em>Why Weight Loss May Stall After the Second Week of Dieting \u2013 The Truth<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.

The same way we approach diet in moderation when it comes to weight loss, we want to view exercising in that same light.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, working out too much is unhealthy and can be unsafe. As we mentioned above, safety should always be a top priority when trying to lose weight. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working out too much is unsustainable for most people and may lead to stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that wasn\u2019t reason enough to squash the overexertion &#8211; perhaps this is: Did you know that when you work out too much, your body can sometimes go into a survival mode and hang on to that stubborn fat even more than it would if you\u2019d been a little less gungho about exercising?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medanta.org\/patient-education-blog\/the-real-reason-youre-not-losing-weight-after-exercising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Medanta eClinic found<\/a>, \u201cIf you exercise too hard on a daily basis, there is an excess of inflammation in your body.

We recommend two workouts: a 30 minute daily walk and 30 minute resistance based circuit training. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chose these exercises for a reason &#8211; they promote weight loss.
