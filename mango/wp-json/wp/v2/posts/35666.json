If you&#8217;re looking for a solution, ChiliSleep has the answer: the Ooler Sleep System! Keep reading for my review of this innovative new product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the ChiliSleep OOLER Sleep System?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">What is the Ooler Sleep System by ChiliSleep? It&#8217;s the best dang thing you can do for yourself if you are suffering through hot flashes and night sweats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">I started going through &#8220;the change&#8221; about 2 years ago, and it&#8217;s been quite the experience so far.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">With hot flashes coming in rapid succession during the day and night sweats waking me up almost every hour at night, I thought my days of restful sleep were over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">Mentally and physically, I was suffering. And as a result, I started gaining weight. As someone who has always pretty easily maintained a healthy weight, I can&#8217;t even begin to express how frustrating this was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">I&#8217;m sure many of you can relate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">A little over a year ago, my husband shared info about a few &#8220;bed cooling systems&#8221;, and was convinced I should get one&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">But I didn&#8217;t look much further once I saw the price tag. I&#8217;m terrible about spending money on myself, even for my own self care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">Fast forward a year, and my husband bought me the Ooler Sleep System by ChiliSleep for Mother&#8217;s Day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">It only took a single night&#8217;s sleep with my new cool mattress pad&#8230;.price tag be damned!

The system circulates water through a hydronic pad placed on top of your mattress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">This helps to keep you cool (or warm) and comfortable all night long. The control unit adjust the temperature of the water coming from the pad, sending it back out at the perfect temperature you specify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">Even though the OOLER Sleep System is primarily used as a cooling pad, it works equally well as a warming pad. There is no need for a separate electric blanket for those that need it in the winter time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/ChiliSleep\"  rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Click here to check out the OOLER Sleep System!<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who should use the OOLER Sleep System?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">Because of the price tag, I would not recommend this product to someone who just needs a warming blanket at night. There are plenty of inexpensive electric blankets on the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">However, I highly recommend this blanket for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Hot flashes<\/strong> &#8211; any women suffering through hot flashes and night sweats as a result of perimenopause or menopause will LOVE this product.<\/li><li><strong>General hot sleepers<\/strong> &#8211; If you find yourself throwing off the covers in the middle of the night or sleep with your feet hanging out of the blankets, this cooling mattress pad is for you.<\/li><li><strong>Athletes <\/strong>&#8211; If you are looking for a way to speed up recovery time, this product can help.

Now I set the thermostat at 70 degrees F at night, which saves a boatload of money, especially in the summer. Plus, I&#8217;m not freezing out the entire family at night.<\/li><li><strong>Best sleep of your life. <\/strong>I&#8217;m not even joking on this one, and my sleep app agrees. I sleep longer, deeper, and feel more rested every morning.<\/li><li><strong>Water-based system.<\/strong> The system sets and maintains more precise temperatures compared to electric or air-based sleep systems.<\/li><li><strong>Lower Sleeping Heart Rate.<\/strong> My overnight sleep heart rate averages 5 points lower than each night since using the OOLER Sleep System.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Drawbacks of using the OOLER Sleep System<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">Honestly, there is only one drawback, and that&#8217;s the price. The cooling mattress pad comes in 2 sizes, Half Queen and Half King, meaning that if your partner wants to benefit from using a cooling mattress, you will have to purchase 2 of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">They offer a payment plan for those than want or need it.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/OOLER-Sleep-System-at-home-Pinterest-Pin-1000-\u00d7-1500-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"OOLER Sleep System at home (Pinterest Pin (1000 \u00d7 1500))\" class=\"wp-image-35671\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/OOLER-Sleep-System-at-home-Pinterest-Pin-1000-\u00d7-1500-683x1024.jpg 683w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/OOLER-Sleep-System-at-home-Pinterest-Pin-1000-\u00d7-1500-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/OOLER-Sleep-System-at-home-Pinterest-Pin-1000-\u00d7-1500-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/OOLER-Sleep-System-at-home-Pinterest-Pin-1000-\u00d7-1500-150x225.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/OOLER-Sleep-System-at-home-Pinterest-Pin-1000-\u00d7-1500.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Ooler worth the money?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">Although the price tag may be off-putting for some, the Ooler Sleep System is definitely worth the investment. The system can be set to your desired temperature, making it a great choice for hot sleepers or those dealing with night sweats. Additionally, the water-based system maintains more precise temperatures than electric or air-based systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">If you are looking for a way to get the <a href=\"https:\/\/trk.chilisleep.com\/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;aff_id=2647&amp;source=ReviewArticle&amp;url_id=19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">best sleep of your life<\/a>, the Ooler Sleep System is worth the investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How long does it take for Ooler to get cold?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">To pre-cool your entire bed, turn on the OOLER Control Unit approximately 20 minutes prior to going to bed. Check that the Reservoir of the Control Unit is full of water and that there are no kinks in the tubing of the Hydronic Pad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">Because it&#8217;s a closed system, you don&#8217;t have to worry about water evaporation, and once full, you should not have to refill the tank. The control system will display a water droplet on screen if it&#8217;s low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">The OOLER app allows you to set a schedule, so you don&#8217;t have to remember to pre-cool the bed. Just set it and forget it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How loud is the Ooler?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">The system has two settings, normal mode and boost mode. Some might consider it pretty loud, but I actually enjoy the white noise effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s louder than a CPAP but quieter than many AC window units.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does Ooler turn off automatically?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">Yes, the OOLER Sleep System will turn off automatically. You simply set the schedule via the <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/ooler\/id1381533477\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ooler app<\/a> and it will automatically turn on for bedtime and turn off at the desired wake time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">In addition to turning off automatically, you can set the warm wake feature in the schedule so the blanket gradually warms up, allowing you to wake up naturally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final thoughts on the ChiliSleep<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">I LOVE my ChiliSleep and would absolutely recommend the OOLER Sleep System to everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0ce9fcc4-63ec-4093-a0e4-aa69df06b68a\">Even though I was initially hesitant due to the price tag, all that went away after one night with the cooling mattress pad.
