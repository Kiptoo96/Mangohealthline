Look no further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, cellulite is a very common problem in which 8<strong>5-90% of women have some form of it.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is cellulite exactly?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a medical condition in which the skin, almost anywhere on the body, becomes dimpled and wrinkly looking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cellulite is <strong>completely reversible<\/strong> in 99% of cases. &nbsp;This is because it is <strong>caused by <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-belly-fat-fast\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">excess fat accumulation<\/a><\/strong> in the body and blood flow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plain and simple. &nbsp;When circulation decreases, the collagen levels of the skin also decrease, and fat cells become larger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the fat cells grow, they begin to \u201cpush\u201d their way to the top as the skin becomes thinner and less elastic. &nbsp;Once the skin has become weak enough, and the fat cells are large enough, cellulite occurs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important parts of getting rid of cellulite have to do with <strong>removing fat off of the body<\/strong> and <strong>improving blood flow to the affected regions.<\/strong> There are a variety of ways to do this, but only seven that seem to have any real science behind them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the seven most effective tips to get rid of cellulite quickly and increase than blood flow!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Don\u2019t waste money on creams, potions, or \u201ccellulite pills.\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That stuff is garbage when it comes to removing cellulite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of those things can treat the real cause of cellulite (lack of blood flow) and are, therefore, a complete waste of your money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Move:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight.jpg\" alt=\"daily walk to lose weight\" class=\"wp-image-7088\" title=\"daily walk to lose weight\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/daily-walk-to-lose-weight-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Stand up. &nbsp;Get up. &nbsp;Start <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/walking-to-lose-weight\/\"  rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">walking around<\/a><\/span>.<\/strong> Start moving your body. Find a hobby or activity that REQUIRES lots of movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more you get up out of that chair and move, the&nbsp;<strong>better blood flow<\/strong>&nbsp;you will have and the quicker the cellulite will go away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple rule of thumb is not to spend more than 1 hour sitting without getting up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Dry brushing<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>WORKS.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I was skeptical of&nbsp;\u201cdry brushing\u201d at first, but it seems to have a&nbsp;<strong>powerful effect on cellulite reduction<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes sense because dry brushing causes a direct and immediate blood flow increase to the region being brushed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00LIBEBTG\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fitincol-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00LIBEBTG&amp;linkId=dda3bdd5022de9a279e2dc808b478da1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">dry brush<\/a><\/strong>&nbsp;and slowly rub the affected area in a circular motion. &nbsp;Do this one time per day for around 5 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any more is unnecessary and can be damaging to the skin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Get a coconut oil massage.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Put your husband or boyfriend to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key here is to let them be a little bit rough with the body. Not that you should be in pain, but the deeper the massage, the better effects it will have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is to&nbsp;<strong>increase circulation<\/strong>&nbsp;in the skin. &nbsp;Using <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/coconut-oil-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">coconut oil<\/a><\/strong> will also better moisturize the skin and help with the healing process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 minutes minimum for best effects!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Hydration is KEY.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Circulation and hydration are best friends. &nbsp;By getting more water into the system, you\u2019ll be&nbsp;<strong>naturally improving blood flow, increasing skin quality, and helping the metabolism<\/strong><strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while most people know the importance of water intake, the majority of people also struggle with sticking to it. &nbsp;Here are a few ideas that will help:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"334\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/large-water-bottle-for-hydration.jpg\" alt=\"large water bottle for hydration\" class=\"wp-image-7633\" title=\"large water bottle for hydration\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/large-water-bottle-for-hydration.jpg 334w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/large-water-bottle-for-hydration-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/large-water-bottle-for-hydration-183x274.jpg 183w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use a half gallon jug of water.&nbsp;<\/strong>Buy a&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2js7MRh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">half gallon jug<\/a>&nbsp;<\/strong>and fill it up with water every morning when you wake up. Yes, you\u2019ll become \u201cthat person\u201d at the office, but that\u2019s ok. Being that person is often a good thing when it comes to being healthy. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use the rubber band technique.<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>Wrap a rubber band around your water bottle every time you fill it up. Try to get in&nbsp;100 ounces&nbsp;per day!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Eliminate sugar.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sugar is one of the primary food villains that causes cellulite. It causes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fat accumulation<\/li><li>Inflammation<\/li><li>Premature skin aging and reduced elasticity<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These three things are some of the primary factors involved in cellulite production. &nbsp;If you need&nbsp;a sweet tooth fix, try gum instead!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See our article on <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/quit-your-sugar-addiction\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">breaking sugar addiction<\/a><\/strong> for more information on how to reduce your sugar intake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Eat more Omega-3 fatty acids.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Omega-3s&nbsp;are one of the only nutrients out there PROVEN through multiple double-blind studies to <strong>increase circulation and blood flow<\/strong>&nbsp;in the body. &nbsp;And it\u2019s not by a small margin either. &nbsp;The increase is sometimes by as much as 30-50%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eat lots of fish like salmon and halibut to get in natural omega-3s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t like fish, supplementation is key. &nbsp;Get a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00CAZAU62\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fitincol-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00CAZAU62&amp;linkId=5efa6c209602c17ddb7027147c215e54\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\"><strong>high-quality omega-3 fish oil,<\/strong><\/a> and supplement on the days you\u2019re not getting in omega 3\u2019s naturally into the diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for a DIET PLAN to help you shed weight and banish cellulite, make sure to check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/strong><\/a> below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People lose an average of <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">10-21 pounds in 21 days<\/a><\/strong> and absolutely love it! &nbsp;But even better than the weight loss is the feedback we get from people about how the program has taught them how to&nbsp;<strong>change&nbsp;their eating habits and find a diet that truly works for them in the long-term<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1153\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min.png\" alt=\"Avocadu 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge\" class=\"wp-image-25089\" title=\"Avocadu 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min.png 1153w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-300x78.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-768x200.png 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-1024x266.png 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-365x95.png 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-355x92.png 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1153px) 100vw, 1153px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We have over 1,000 people in our private support group going through the Challenge together, and every day they are <strong>sharing&nbsp;experiences, results, motivation, and lots of recipes!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are ready to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">make some&nbsp;changes in your life<\/a><\/strong>, this is the ONLY place you should start. &nbsp;We will teach you exactly how to make the necessary changes in your diet and your lifestyle and how to keep them <strong>&#8220;beyond the diet.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Click here to get started with YOUR 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge today!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you liked this article on how to get rid of cellulite on the thighs and but or have any questions, please leave them in the comment section below!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking to get rid of cellulite on your thighs and your butt?
