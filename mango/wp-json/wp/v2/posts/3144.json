This will give you the strength to overcome those times of weakness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The most effective way to do this is to connect with others and share your struggles.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"302\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/shutterstock_88658104-e1600721036775.jpg\" alt=\"join a weight loss program to stay motivated to lose weight\" class=\"wp-image-3127\" title=\"join a weight loss program to stay motivated to lose weight\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining weight loss support groups should NOT be underestimated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the 3 best ways to get continued support and stronger willpower:<br><strong>1. Find a friend or family member you can confide in who shares the same struggles.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell them about your goals and what you\u2019re trying to accomplish. Call or text them when you\u2019re feeling weak or are lacking motivation. This has a surprisingly strong effect and is backed by science.<br><strong>2. Join a gym that has a built-in community.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like CrossFit are effective because they have a built-in community support program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to find a gym that has this, and make strong connections with others who have similar goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>3. Get support when on the Internet.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should follow some popular fitness people for continued motivation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have Instagram, follow some fitness people you admire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that you know of the common mistakes, let&#8217;s move on to how to stay motivated for weight loss&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Turn Off Your Computer and TV<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever finished watching a couple of TV episodes on Netflix and felt <em>tired<\/em>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve done nothing but sat on the couch and ate a pint of Ben a Jerry&#8217;s, but now for some reason you don\u2019t feel like doing anything\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a scientific reason for this. &nbsp;The basic breakdown is:<br><strong>1. Your brain can only handle so much awesome stimulation throughout the day.<\/strong><br><strong>2. The novelty of the Internet and TV causes a quick OVERLOAD of this stimulation.<\/strong><br><strong>3. As a result, the mind feels tired and you feel \u201cunmotivated\u201d to do anything else.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">When you turn off these items for a day or two, you will notice at first that you feel a bit bored, like the noise meter on life has been turned down a bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Then you will notice an abundant desire to do things:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Go hang out with friends<br>&#8211; Take care of your \u201cto-do\u2019s\u201d<br>&#8211; Go workout<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not that TV and the Internet are bad things, it&#8217;s just&nbsp;that they are a <strong>COLOSSAL<\/strong> drain on your ability to stay motivated and get stuff&nbsp;done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By cutting these things down to an hour or less per day, you will immediately notice more motivation in your life.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re really struggling, consider a fast from them. It may seem extreme, but the rewards will shock you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.

Look around at those 5 people you\u2019re around the most and examine them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bet their lives mirror yours: income, looks, happiness, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The people you surround yourself with <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">matter<\/span><\/strong>.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They matter much more than you could ever imagine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In fact, some of the latest scientific research has shown that in times of weakness, having a strong community will keep you on track and will replenish your willpower reserves.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We all have times we are feeling weak and want to falter.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, talking to a friend or support group will short-circuit these feelings and give you a quick burst of motivation to RESIST.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just having some support you can call on is a valuable resource. &nbsp;Have a friend or group you can confide in and that you can call during your times of being tempted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Get Results Faster<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You know what&#8217;s not motivating?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing only 1 pound a week while eating like a rabbit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s total crap, and yet every diet promotes it as&nbsp;the &#8220;smart&#8221; way to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially, when the science tells us that losing weight fast&nbsp;leads to more success in both the short term and the long term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">program that gets you results FAST<\/a><\/span> and doesn&#8217;t waste any time getting you what you want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s much more motiving seeing the scale drop 1 pound a day for your first 7 days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Motivation Fades. Habits Stick Around.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Habits trump motivation in the battle for actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How?<br><strong>Because habits are not based on feelings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re performing a habit, you will feel almost indifferent about it. Like brushing your teeth or going to work. It\u2019s just something that you do, not something you have to think about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great thing about habits is that&nbsp;don\u2019t take away any of your willpower.<br><em><strong>Both good and bad, once established (takes around 30-60 days), habits are hard to break.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with something simple. &nbsp;My recommendation is a healthy breakfast.&nbsp;Keep it simple and eat an incredibly healthy breakfast every day. Something like plain oatmeal with cinnamon and nuts on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can establish this habit, you\u2019ll also notice that <em>making other healthy decisions will become easier as a result. &nbsp;<\/em><strong>This is because habits build on one another.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Establish a New Relationship With Your Food<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kind of the reverse here \u2013 but let\u2019s think about what foods cause you to break.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cookies, Pizza, Cakes, and Cokes, right?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not the food group though that is addicting, it\u2019s two components:<br><strong>Sugar and Flour.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>They are the same two components for everybody.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a reason for this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>These are the foods that cause the highest insulin and dopamine spikes in your brain. These spikes are as great (sometimes greater) than drugs like cocaine or heroin.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sound far-fetched?
