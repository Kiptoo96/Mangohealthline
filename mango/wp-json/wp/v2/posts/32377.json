She shares some great science-backed tips and information for anyone interested in losing weight without consuming animal products.]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Veganism is known for its ethical and environmental benefits, but a vegan diet can also help you achieve your weight loss goals and improve your health.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A vegan diet <strong>excludes all animal products like meats, dairy, eggs, and honey<\/strong>, <strong>but vegan junk food also exists.<\/strong> This is why it is important to learn the proper way to follow a plant-based diet that can lead to effortless weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this guide, you will discover 7 key factors to start a <a href=\"https:\/\/veganfitguide.com\/vegan-weight-loss\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vegan diet<\/a> that help you achieve your weight loss goals. Let\u2019s get started!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Eat High Protein Vegan Foods<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Protein is one of the most important nutrients for weight loss<\/strong> since it can boost your metabolism, help reduce appetite and regulate weight-controlling hormones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And contrary to popular belief, there are plenty of vegan sources where you can get your protein from. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you are new to a vegan diet it is important to be intentional and make sure to include high-protein foods in all your meals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tofu-min.png\" alt=\"Cooked tofu with sesame seeds sprinkled on top\" class=\"wp-image-32393\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tofu-min.png 660w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tofu-min-300x193.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tofu-min-20x13.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the best sources of vegan protein include<strong> tofu, tempeh, seitan, and legumes<\/strong> such as beans and lentils which are great staples to build your meals around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, foods like <strong>vegetables, nuts, and seeds<\/strong> can also help you increase your protein intake and support your weight loss goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Avoid Oils and High Fat Foods<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trends like the mediterranean and keto diet have given olive and coconut oil a reputation for being weight-loss friendly. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, they are often highly processed foods that offer low nutrients compared to the high number of calories per serving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give you an idea, vegetables typically have around 100 calories per pound and fruits 300 calories per pound. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Oil, on the other hand, has 4,000 calories per pound.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same applies to junk and fast food which are usually <strong>fried <\/strong>or<strong> made with a lot of oil<\/strong> to add flavor to it and help preserve it in a cheap way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Don\u2019t Be Afraid of Fiber<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fiber has many health benefits including being beneficial for weight loss. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Since it takes longer to digest than sugar and simple carbs, fiber is more satiating and keeps you full for longer. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, helping you avoid cravings and stay on track with your diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Fiber-min.png\" alt=\"Fruits and Vegetables -Apples, carrots, grapes, bananas, and broccoli\" class=\"wp-image-32394\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Fiber-min.png 660w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Fiber-min-300x193.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Fiber-min-20x13.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Vegans already eat more fiber than those on a regular American diet but <strong>being mindful about your fiber intake can help you lose weight faster,<\/strong> even if that is the only change you make to your diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, a study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that dieters who made sure to get <strong>at least 30 grams of fiber a day<\/strong> lost a significant amount of weight, despite being given no other dietary parameters.&nbsp; (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bostonmagazine.com\/health\/2015\/02\/17\/want-lose-weight-eat-fiber\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Increasing fiber intake is so effective&#8211;especially when it comes from vegetables&#8211;that this is one of the key weight loss methods in Avocadu&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Choose the Right Type of Carbs<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbohydrates (also known as carbs) have long been demonized as weight loss\u2019 worst enemy, but they are actually the most efficient energy source for your body and an essential part of a weight loss diet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>However, not all carbs are made the same&#8230;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/fibrous-carbs\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"29782\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Whole carbs<\/a> like <em>grains, tubers, legumes, and vegetables are minimally processed and are full of fiber and nutrients <\/em>so they keep you satiated while providing sustained energy for your daily tasks and exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Carbs-min.png\" alt=\"Healthy Carbohydrates - beans, black beans, red lentils, green lentils\" class=\"wp-image-32396\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Carbs-min.png 660w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Carbs-min-300x193.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Carbs-min-20x13.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/carb-detox-to-lose-weight\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"30884\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">processed carbs<\/a> such as white flour, pastries, sodas, snacks, pasta, sweets, and added sugars have had most of the nutrients and fiber removed<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, they cause rapid spikes in blood sugar and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-weight-insulin-resistance-diet\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"30815\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">insulin levels<\/a>, followed by a drop in blood sugar, that leads to cravings and overeating. (<a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/10049982\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Be Cautious of Substitutes<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the huge variety of vegan substitutes for meat and dairy available nowadays, following a plant-based diet is undoubtedly easier than it was 10 or even 5 years ago. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you must be careful not to assume that just because something is vegan, it is healthy or conducive to your weight loss goals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these substitutes<strong> like burgers and cheeses are highly processed foods, dense in calories and low in nutrients, <\/strong>so it is best to avoid them or keep them to a minimum.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn\u2019t apply to milk substitutes since they are usually lower in calories than their animal counterparts and provide protein and nutrients like vitamin B12.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just make sure to choose an unsweetened option like <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3l9CiBd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Planet Oat Oatmilk<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3DLz9Qd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Silk Organic Unsweetened Soy Milk<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Calories Still Matter<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The science behind weight loss is simple: When you eat fewer calories than what your body burns on a daily basis, it is \u201cforced\u201d to use fat stores for energy, resulting in a reduction in body fat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is true regardless of the type of diet you follow, vegan or not. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it is important to remember that <strong>a plant-based diet is not a magic weight loss recipe<\/strong> and you can still gain weight if you eat more calories than you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you eat <strong>mostly whole foods and avoid processed ones, you will effortlessly create a caloric deficit <\/strong>without worrying about calories and tracking everything you eat. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to mention you will get all the nutrients your body needs and feel amazing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Set Yourself Up for Success<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, <strong>prepare yourself for success by always carrying a healthy vegan snack with you<\/strong> wherever you go, especially as you get used to eating a plant-based diet. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some ideas of some snacks that are easy to bring with you on-the-go:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A handful of almonds<\/li><li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3DFEV69\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">vegan protein bar<\/a><\/li><li>A veggies and hummus wrap<\/li><li>A serving of your favorite fruit<\/li><li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3kV8S9A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">PB2<\/a> and jelly sandwich<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Snacks-min.png\" alt=\"Healthy Snack - protein bar with nuts and seeds\" class=\"wp-image-32400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Snacks-min.png 660w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Snacks-min-300x193.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Snacks-min-20x13.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>While nowadays vegan alternatives are everywhere, you don\u2019t want to risk being in a situation where you are hungry and don\u2019t have any healthy vegan food available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can a vegan diet make you lose weight?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While veganism is an ethical choice, recent studies show that following a plant based diet might also help you lose a significant amount of weight.
