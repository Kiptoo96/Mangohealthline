If so, you may be focusing on eating healthy foods, watching your portions and exercising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>But what are you drinking? <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re not paying attention to your water intake, you\u2019re missing out on a major factor that helps with weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinking more water can help you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>burn more calories,<\/li><li>suppress your appetite, and<\/li><li>flush toxins from your body<\/li><li>Cut calories when replacing other drinks<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Among other things&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have probably heard that you\u2019re supposed to drink eight glasses of water a day. However, the right amount for you may depend on your current weight and activity level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodybuilding.com\/fun\/water_calculator.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">water calculator<\/span><\/a> that can help you determine how much to drink. If your urine is dark in color, you should be taking in more water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some scientific ways in which drinking more water can help you lose those extra pounds and inches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Boost the Burn Without Adding Exercise<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m&nbsp;not saying that you shouldn\u2019t get moving, but <strong>drinking water can increase the number of calories that your body burns<\/strong> just doing what you\u2019re already doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to one&nbsp;study, within 10 minutes of drinking about 2.25 cups of water, your metabolism is boosted by 30%. The effect lasts for about 30 to 40 minutes (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14671205\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s because every time you eat, your body burns some calories to process the food or beverage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Water is a negative-calorie food. Your body uses up more calories to send the hydration to the cells throughout your body than it takes in when you drink the water.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d have to drink a dangerous amount of water to lose weight via this method alone, but it can help speed up your metabolism if you\u2019re already taking other measures to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Curb Your Appetite<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"348\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/drink-water-to-curb-appetite.jpg\" alt=\"drink water to curb appetite\" class=\"wp-image-8407\" title=\"drink water to curb appetite\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/drink-water-to-curb-appetite.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/drink-water-to-curb-appetite-300x209.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/drink-water-to-curb-appetite-365x254.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Water is a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/7-natural-appetite-suppressants-for-healthy-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">natural ppetite suppressant<\/span><\/a>. Have you ever tried chugging a glass of water when you\u2019re hungry?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes your stomach feel full. You simply don\u2019t have the room to cram in a lot of food after that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies support this notion. One study showed that a group of dieters who drank water before meals lost 44% more weight than the participants who didn\u2019t start their meals with the beverage (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19661958\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the researchers aren\u2019t exactly sure why participants\u2019 appetites were suppressed, they believe it has to do with water\u2019s filling effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip side, signs of hunger may be indicators that you\u2019re dehydrated. Next time you feel like you have low energy, dizziness or a grumbling stomach, try drinking water before grabbing a snack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your body may be trying to tell you that you\u2019re thirsty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do drink water before a meal, try to space it out by about 30 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Too much water in your digestive system can dilute the enzymes that are necessary to help you properly process and absorb the nutrients from your food.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Cut Calories<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One can of Coca-Cola contains 140 calories. If you drink two cans of soda each day, replacing them with water can help you <em>lose an extra pound every 12 weeks<\/em> or so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Observational research shows that people who drink water do take in about 194 fewer calories each day than people who drink juice or soft drinks (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16421349\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have trouble swapping something sweet for water, try <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/detox-water-recipes\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">infusing your water with fruits<\/a><\/span> or vegetables. Watermelon, cucumber, citrus, and berries add flavor and a hint of sweetness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Drinking Water May Help You Eat Healthier Foods<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/protein-and-veggie-detox-for-21-day-diet-challenge-200-lbs.jpg\" alt=\"protein and veggie detox for 21 day diet challenge 200 bs\" class=\"wp-image-25977\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/protein-and-veggie-detox-for-21-day-diet-challenge-200-lbs.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/protein-and-veggie-detox-for-21-day-diet-challenge-200-lbs-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/protein-and-veggie-detox-for-21-day-diet-challenge-200-lbs-365x242.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/protein-and-veggie-detox-for-21-day-diet-challenge-200-lbs-355x236.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies show that people who drink more water tend to have healthier eating patterns in general. These individuals tend to eat more fruits and vegetables than people who drink calorie-laden beverages (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16421349\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydration and healthy eating patterns are also linked to education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That makes sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>People who know what\u2019s healthy for them are more likely to make better decisions across the board when it comes to their wellness.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Drinking Ice Water May Boost Your Metabolism<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you drink ice water, your body has to heat it up before using it. That process burns some extra calories. While some research does support this theory, some experts say that it\u2019s simply not true (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/diet\/news\/20040105\/drinking-water-may-speed-weight-loss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it doesn\u2019t hurt to throw some ice in your water, especially if it helps you get more down. If it helps you burn extra calories, that\u2019s great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just don\u2019t look at it as some miracle weight loss strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Workouts are Improved with Hydration<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re properly hydrated, you experience fewer muscle cramps. Your joints remain lubricated, allowing you to work out more effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your heart pumps blood more efficiently to your muscles when you\u2019re hydrated.<\/strong> This is even more of a factor for overweight people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your mobility is on point, and your body feels good, you\u2019re more likely to exercise to burn off those extra calories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"326\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/drink-water-while-exercising.jpg\" alt=\"drink water while exercising\" class=\"wp-image-8405\" title=\"drink water while exercising\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/drink-water-while-exercising.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/drink-water-while-exercising-300x196.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/drink-water-while-exercising-365x238.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time you feel thirsty, you are already dehydrated. In fact, thirst is an indication that you\u2019ve lost the amount of water that\u2019s equivalent to 2% of your body weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reports that your workout performance drops significantly at that point too (<a href=\"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/72\/2\/564s.full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can you tell if you\u2019re drinking enough water during your workouts?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weigh yourself before and after your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/10-killer-workouts-burn-fat-running\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exercise routine.<\/a> If your weight drops by 2% or more after a workout, you\u2019re not drinking enough water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For someone who weighs 115 pounds, that\u2019s a drop of about 2 pounds. For a 175-pound individual, that\u2019s a loss of 3.5 pounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make sure that you\u2019re drinking enough, down a full glass of water about 15 minutes before a workout. Continue to drink about 8 ounces every 30 minutes while you\u2019re sweating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make sure to drink more if you\u2019re perspiring excessively or working out in hot weather.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Water Flushes Out Toxins<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your kidneys need water to filter toxins from the body. If the toxins aren\u2019t flushed out, the body holds onto them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can cause <strong>inflammation<\/strong>, which is linked to obesity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Water can also <strong>help move stool through the digestive system,<\/strong> which also removes toxins from the system. Without enough water, you may become constipated, leading to bloating and digestive distress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other liquids aren\u2019t as beneficial for flushing out toxins. In fact, an energy drink or soft drink may add more toxins to the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding squeezed lemon to your water can increase its toxin-flushing benefits, though. Many people tout the benefits of drinking lemon water first thing in the morning to get your digestive juices flowing and cleanse your system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/6DN-Kulnm20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this video<\/a><\/span> to get a recipe for detox water that can help flush your system and assist with weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Our 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge REQUIRES a 100-ounce daily water intake. <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because water is an elemental nutrient in the body and you must&nbsp;be drinking LOTS to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lose 10-21 pounds in 21 days<\/a><\/span>, which is exactly what our program can do for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even better than the weight loss is the feedback we get from people about how the program has taught them how to&nbsp;<strong>change&nbsp;their eating habits and find a diet that truly works for them in the long-term<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1153\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min.png\" alt=\"Avocadu 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge\" class=\"wp-image-25089\" title=\"Avocadu 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min.png 1153w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-300x78.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-768x200.png 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-1024x266.png 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-365x95.png 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-355x92.png 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1153px) 100vw, 1153px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are ready to make some&nbsp;changes in your life, this is the ONLY place you should start. &nbsp;We will teach you exactly how to make the necessary changes in your diet&nbsp;and your lifestyle and how to keep them &#8220;beyond the diet.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Click here to get started with YOUR 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge today!<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoyed this article on how drinking more water can help you lose weight or have any questions, please leave them in the comment section below!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you trying to lose weight?
