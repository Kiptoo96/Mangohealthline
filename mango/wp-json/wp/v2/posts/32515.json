Balanced Hormones<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Yoga-min.png\" alt=\"Woman on a yoga mat in\" class=\"wp-image-32522\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Yoga-min.png 660w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Yoga-min-300x193.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Yoga-min-20x13.png 20w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Yoga-min-150x97.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>For us women, our hormones seem to control everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And they really do.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our sex hormones (Estrogen, Progesterone, and Testosterone) control everything from our <strong>sex drive<\/strong> to our <strong>emotional state<\/strong>, to how easily we can <strong>conceive<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our stress hormone Cortisol can disrupt our hormone balance, and cause us to feel <strong>tired, bloated, irritable, more emotional than normal, anxious, depressed<\/strong>, and can even inhibit our ability to lose or gain weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounds like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthyremedies.com.au\/stress-causes-pms-period-pain-period-problems\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PMS<\/a> to you too, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is because elevated cortisol depletes our sex hormones. Primarily progesterone.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Progesterone is the hormone that helps us with pregnancy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have the highest levels of Progesterone in our <a href=\"https:\/\/helloclue.com\/articles\/cycle-a-z\/the-menstrual-cycle-more-than-just-the-period\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">luteal phase<\/a>, right after ovulation. This is when progesterone helps the body prepare for a baby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If we have low progesterone (due to high cortisol) the body can\u2019t sustain a pregnancy.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it essentially tries to flush out the uterine lining as fast as possible, causing a painful and possibly heavy period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reducing stress in our lives can help balance out our female sex hormones by reducing cortisol, and relieving some of these PMS symptoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Cycle Regulation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Life is just easier when you have an idea of when your period is going to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are one of many women with an irregular cycle, you may have wondered what might be causing it to be so off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things that can <strong>cause an irregular cycle, like a hormone imbalance or <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/how-to-lose-weight-with-pcos\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"26707\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PCOS<\/a><\/strong>. But stress can also play a big part in whether or not we have a regular cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having<strong> high cortisol levels <\/strong>can affect the part of the brain (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.merckmanuals.com\/home\/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders\/pituitary-gland-disorders\/overview-of-the-pituitary-gland\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the pituitary gland<\/a>) responsible for creating and releasing hormones, as well as our adrenals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In women, this could result in lowered sex hormones, irregular menstrual cycles, and missing periods altogether.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lowering our stress levels can help take pressure off of the pituitary gland and adrenals, and regulate these cycles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.
