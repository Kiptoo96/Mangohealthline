Yoga is like a secret potion for your body.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Flexibility<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexibility is one of the most noticeable changes that regular yoga practice brings. As you flow through different poses, you&#8217;ll gradually <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-poses-for-flexibility\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"5835\">increase your range of motion<\/a> and stretch muscles that may have been dormant for years.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those seemingly impossible contortions will become more attainable with time and practice. Before you know it, you&#8217;ll be touching your toes, doing backbends, and twisting like a pretzel.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part? Increased flexibility not only makes you feel amazing, but it also improves your overall posture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Benefits-of-Practicing-Yoga-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Benefits of Practicing Yoga lotus pose\" class=\"wp-image-36606\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Benefits-of-Practicing-Yoga-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Benefits-of-Practicing-Yoga-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Benefits-of-Practicing-Yoga-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Benefits-of-Practicing-Yoga-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Benefits-of-Practicing-Yoga.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Improved Posture<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of posture, yoga works wonders for straightening you up. Whether you spend long hours at a desk or find yourself slouching unconsciously, yoga will come to your rescue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The various asanas (poses) focus on elongating the spine, opening up the chest, and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/8-yoga-poses-strong-core\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"4269\">strengthening the core muscles<\/a>.
