This process causes the plants to produce increased amounts of chlorophyll (one of the world&#8217;s most powerful antioxidants) and give them their beautiful green color! Then the tea leaves are picked and REQUIRED to be stone-ground into a fine powder, which gives the tea its rich and unique taste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matcha is the premium grade tea of the Japanese people.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting history with Samurais&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The powder originally was only available to royalty and Samurais, because it was so expensive to produce. Samurais would drink&nbsp;the tea for its health benefits and ability to focus during combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it is a common staple in the Japanese diet (one of the healthiest cultures in the world).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Natural Weight Loss<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing weight is difficult, especially if you don&#8217;t have a naturally fast metabolism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A study featured in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition demonstrated that green tea powder increased thermogenesis (the body&#8217;s rate of burning calories) from 8-10% to 35-43% of daily energy expenditure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matcha green tea powder will speed up your metabolism and help you lose weight faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Naturally Detoxifies the Body<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Man-made toxins such as heavy metals, dioxins, and hormone disrupters are stored in the body from the preservatives in our diets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shading process of matcha makes it rich in the antioxidant, chlorophyll. This nutrient helps safely <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/top-10-reasons-to-detoxify-your-body\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cleanse<\/a><\/span> and eliminate these harmful chemicals and heavy metals in the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Energy Without Jitters<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Caffeine is great, but sometimes it causes jitters and shakiness when we have too much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great thing about matcha is that it contains the amino acid L-Theanine, which helps balance out the caffeine. This amino acid is known to help with creating a sense of calmness without causing you to feel sleepy or drowsy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Cancer-Fighting Antioxidants<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Free-radical buildup is one of the major factors in premature aging. It\u2019s caused by a whole host of sources, including diet and stress levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matcha&#8217;s antioxidant levels (the destroyer of free-radicals) are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>6.2 times that of Goji Berries<\/li><li>7 times that of Dark Chocolate<\/li><li>17 times that of Wild Blueberries<\/li><li>60.5 times that of Spinach<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Boosts Memory and Concentration<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stress induces the brain\u2019s beta waves, which leads to an agitated and unfocused state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matcha contains 5x more L-Theanine than conventional green tea. This amino acid has also been shown to increase the alpha waves in the brain, which lead to better concentration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alpha waves have also been shown to reduce stress and even lower blood pressure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Makes Exercise More Effective<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/exercises-to-lose-belly-fat\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Exercising<\/a><\/span> is difficult, but matcha makes it better in 2 ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Studies have demonstrated that exercising immediately after drinking matcha green tea resulted in 25% more fat burning during exercise!<br>2. Matcha will give you more focus and concentration, so you\u2019ll be able to push yourself harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Strengthens the Immune System<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our immune systems have become more and more compromised as new strains of bacteria and viruses become stronger every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00DDT116M\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00DDT116M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=h3o-matchagreenteapowder-20&amp;linkId=E5SEDMVX2ADVAGCN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Matcha green tea<\/span><\/a> will help you fight back. Because of its crazy high antioxidant levels and catechins, the more you have, the more equipped your body will be to fight off infections and diseases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matcha will help improve your immune system, so your body will get sick less often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Tastes GREAT<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chlorophyll and amino acids give matcha its unique rich taste, an initial vegetal, astringent taste, followed by a lingering sweetness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The intensity of the experience compares to the&nbsp;first taste of dark chocolate or red wine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When added as an ingredient, the taste of matcha becomes subtler. It adds the flavor and color of green tea to your creation, be it a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/the-simple-green-smoothie-recipe\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smoothie<\/a><\/span>, latte, savory sauce, or pastry!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Improves Skin Health<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The same antioxidants that make green tea protective, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), may also help support skin health by reducing inflammation and free radicals that accelerate skin aging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>10. Anti-Aging Properties<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The people who have been known to live the longest are the residents of Okinawa, Japan. The Okinawan people&#8217;s longevity has been partly attributed to regular consumption of matcha green tea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matcha green tea is the most popular green tea in Japan&nbsp;and&nbsp;is rapidly gaining more popularity throughout the world because of its ability to combat inflammation, oxidation, and aging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matcha has many anti-aging properties that will keep you looking and feeling younger!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where do I buy matcha green tea?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many matcha caf\u00e9s popping up all over the world, especially in the U.S. At these cafes, a cup of matcha might cost you as much as $4 per cup! Thankfully, you can brew matcha inexpensively at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will want to get an organic brand that&nbsp;has&nbsp;a good track record (there are some fakers out there), and also make sure that it&#8217;s organic.

You want tea leaves that are made in a safe environment and have a very bright green color to them. This ensures the leaves have the most chlorophyll and greatest nutrient value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Additional Bonuses for Buying:<\/strong> Some brands give bonuses for buying their brand of matcha like \u201cmatcha Recipes,\u201d so we felt like that would be important to you as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also encourage you to try out a couple if you&#8217;re very interested. &nbsp;See how they taste and how your body responds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Leave a comment below if you enjoyed this article on the incredible health benefits of matcha green tea powder or have any questions!<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I recently read that matcha green tea was amongst the top 10 new health trends for 2016.
