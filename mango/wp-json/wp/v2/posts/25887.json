Motivation is fleeting, and losing weight takes time.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While in the next 10 minutes you can have Jimmy John\u2019s delivering sandwiches to your doorstep, <strong>it may take more than a month to lose 10 pounds<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/woman-with-no-motivation-to-lose-weight.jpg\" alt=\"woman with no motivation to lose weight\" class=\"wp-image-5667\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The main problem people face when wondering how to stay motivated to lose weight is that motivation wears off, and temptation will always exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zig Ziglar has a good quote about the solution to this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;\u201cPeople often say motivation doesn\u2019t last.&nbsp;Well, neither does bathing. That\u2019s why we recommend it daily.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret here is to use our incredible 21<sup>st<\/sup> century technology to <strong>keep reinvigorating yourself with more motivation.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easy ways to do this are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Listen to daily podcasts on being healthy.<\/li><li>Read books or&nbsp;use audible.com to listen to health and fitness audiobooks.<\/li><li>Join a community of people working towards similar goals!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these things will help re-inspire you and keep you motivated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Everyone has limited amounts of willpower.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever noticed that<strong> it\u2019s easier to make tough decisions in the morning but harder to make them evening?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because your willpower, similar to a muscle, is a <strong>limited resource. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a long day of hard decision making, a psychological syndrome called <strong>decision fatigue<\/strong> sets in and makes it more difficult to say no to that pizza.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution here is to <strong>use habits instead of relying on willpower.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Habits, since not consciously made, don\u2019t dip into those willpower reserves and are decisions made on autopilot.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple habits like drinking a large glass of water right when you wake up or not eating after 7 pm are easy to establish and will help you when your motivation and willpower fades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a short video on the&nbsp;<strong>health benefits of apple cider vinegar<\/strong>&nbsp;on our Youtube Channel, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCHqbu8d5NIZ_Mp6H4aejVOg?sub_confirmation=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Health Nerd<\/a>,&nbsp;that you might find helpful!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/O9ouhTy2QBU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Progress can be deceiving.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The mirror plays games when it comes to losing weight and getting in shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many dieters have experienced the situation where they are losing weight and feeling better, but are <strong>seeing no physical results in the mirror.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be crazy frustrating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution is that<strong> measurements don\u2019t lie. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may not sound sexy, but diligent tracking progress is crucial for success. Yes, take photos, but also make sure to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Weigh yourself<\/li><li>Take measurements<\/li><li>Take videos<\/li><li>And keep studious track of these records.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Progress = motivation and this will keep you from getting discouraged by the mirror.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Being healthy doesn\u2019t have to suck.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When most people think about getting healthy and fit, they envision <strong>eating dry chicken breast, bland broccoli, and running for hours on the treadmill.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\u2019t have to be like that, nor should it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find something you love, especially when it comes to exercise:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Yoga<\/li><li>Pilates<\/li><li>Crossfit<\/li><li>Biking<\/li><li>Running<\/li><li>Hiking<\/li><li>Weight Lifting<\/li><li>Swimming<\/li><li>Etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are A TON of options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all those options out there, <strong>you have no excuse not to find something you love and can stick with.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that <strong>a perfect workout routine you hate is going to be less effective than finding a type of exercise you love and can stick with.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Design small rewards for sticking to the plan.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We humans may think we are complex and gifted beings, however, we are still simple animals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basic reward systems in almost all major weight loss studies work on us just like our furry brethren.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Having a cheat meal once a week or even a reward day every few weeks on a diet can provide a lot of psychological relief and something to look forward to on those more temptation filled days.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also something that we have incorporated into our popular fast weight loss program, the <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>21-Day Fat Loss Challenge.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1153\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min.png\" alt=\"Avocadu 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge\" class=\"wp-image-25089\" title=\"Avocadu 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min.png 1153w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-300x78.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-768x200.png 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-1024x266.png 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-365x95.png 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Avocadu-New-21-Day-Challenge-min-355x92.png 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1153px) 100vw, 1153px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of our clients weigh over 200 pounds and have a LOT of weight to lose.
