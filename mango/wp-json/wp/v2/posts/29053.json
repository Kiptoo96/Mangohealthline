Wits, intelligence, life experience, yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your body at 50 years old vs. 20 years old is just different. There&#8217;s no other way to say it.

Understand Hormonal Changes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Harvard, our estrogen hormone levels drop steeply or spike higher than normal after age 45 which results in weight gain. In fact, about 30% of women aged 50-59 are not just overweight, but pretty much obese (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/womens-health\/perimenopause-rocky-road-to-menopause\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why? It is because <strong>estrogen has a direct connection to body weight regulation.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A study has shown that a lower estrogen level leads to eating more and being less physically active. If that\u2019s not enough, it also <strong>slows down your metabolism<\/strong> which ultimately leads to middle-age spread (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.womenshealth.northwestern.edu\/blog\/menopause-and-weight-gain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because low estrogen level means weight gain, then it is only logical to think that estrogen hormone therapy can reverse the effects and promote weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you are not comfortable with this choice, there are still other alternative options to choose from to help you lose weight after age 40 such as diet and exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can start by incorporating some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-in\/foodanddrink\/foodnews\/estrogen-rich-foods-you-should-include-in-your-diet\/ar-BBN7CiP?li=AAgg9gJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">healthy foods<\/span><\/a> that are known to boost estrogen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also read more about how hormones affect weight gain in <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/how-hormones-affect-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">this article<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

We all know vegetables are good for your health so when we choose to implement a vegetarian diet, the benefits go beyond weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to research, vegan diets can help decrease fat and saturated fat more than the pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian, and omnivorous diet counterparts at both 2 and 6 months (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25592014\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A word of caution about vegan and vegetarian diets:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fff47d;\"><strong>A plant-based diet is ONLY healthier when you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">cut out<\/span> processed foods entirely. i.e. Do NOT substitute meat or dairy for processed, &#8220;fake,&#8221; soy-based meat\/dairy products.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Balanced Diet<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A balanced diet gives your body the nutrients it needs to function correctly, especially if you\u2019re over 45.

That makes this kind of diet a little more agreeable with your social life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Watch Your Eating Habits<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your eating habits define how you eat. After age 45, our bodies no longer burn that many calories because of <strong>slower metabolism.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, it is very important to be <strong>mindful of how we eat<\/strong>. You need to implement some changes in your eating habits such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Intermittent Fasting<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/intermittent-fasting-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intermittent fasting<\/span><\/a> is not a diet but a <strong>timed approach to eating.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research from the University of Southern California states that eating within a 15-hour window or more a day leads to metabolic problems, sleep disorders, and other health hazards (<a href=\"https:\/\/news.usc.edu\/135551\/fasting-aging-dieting-and-when-you-should-eat-valter-longo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did it scare you? Then good, it\u2019s about time to make some changes to your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/build-healthy-habits-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">eating habits.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re not a fan of strict diets, try intermittent fasting where you cycle between periods of eating and fasting. Unlike conventional diets that tell you what to eat and restricts where calories come from, it does not specify what foods a person should eat or avoid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you want to lose weight faster after age 45, then a healthy diet with intermittent fasting should do the trick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fff47d;\"><strong>The most basic thing you need to know about intermittent fasting is you need to have an \u201ceating window\u201d or time to eat and a \u201cfasting window\u201d or time to fast.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of methods for intermittent fasting such as alternate day fasting and 14:10\/16:8 method. The former simply means fasting every other day while the latter means restricting your eating to 10-8 hours per day only.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intermittent fasting also can help postmenopausal women ages 50 to 79 to lose weight (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.aarp.org\/health\/conditions-treatments\/info-2018\/weight-loss-menopause-belly.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>).

It is based on the understanding that you need to burn more calories than you consume especially after age 45.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, it is as simple as <strong>eating the right amount of food.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/eat-smaller-portions-to-get-less-calories-when-eating-out.jpg\" alt=\"eat smaller portions to get less calories when eating out\" class=\"wp-image-26319\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/eat-smaller-portions-to-get-less-calories-when-eating-out.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/eat-smaller-portions-to-get-less-calories-when-eating-out-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/eat-smaller-portions-to-get-less-calories-when-eating-out-365x244.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/eat-smaller-portions-to-get-less-calories-when-eating-out-355x237.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean even if all you eat are healthy foods but you have too big a portion size than your body really needs, then your weight loss journey after age 45 will fail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways you can do this is by simply serving smaller portions and then having a glass of water with dinner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The water will help you feel satiated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re really starving, wait 10 minutes before going back for seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fff47d;\"><strong>9 times out of 10, you&#8217;re going back for seconds out of boredom or habit rather than actual hunger.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, don\u2019t just take my word for it!
