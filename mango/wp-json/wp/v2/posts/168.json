Ingestion of this ingredient has been shown to help prevent bladder, colon, and prostate cancers. Be careful not to cook it too long if you&#8217;re interested in its cancer preventative qualities. Make sure to steam it and\/or cut it into small pieces when cooking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most notable nutrients per 100&nbsp;grams:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Vitamin K &#8211; 59% of RDA<\/li><li>Vitamin C &#8211; 44% of RDA<\/li><li>Vitamin B6 &#8211; 13% of RDA<\/li><li>Manganese &#8211; 9% of RDA<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>17. Raspberries<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to lose a few pounds, raspberries should be making it into your diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raspberries are known to have high concentrations of antioxidants and help fight aging, but there are also some remarkable studies on their effect on metabolism. Raspberry ketone helps improve the metabolism of fat cells in the body and will help burn fat faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also&nbsp;contain&nbsp;rheosmin, which helps decrease enzyme activity and decreases the absorption of fat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most notable nutrients per 100&nbsp;grams:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Vitamin C &#8211; 38% of RDA<\/li><li>Manganese &#8211; 35% of RDA<\/li><li>Fiber &#8211; 27% of RDA<\/li><li>&nbsp;Vitamin K &#8211; 8% of RDA<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>&nbsp;18.

Consumption of allium has many benefits, including an improved cardiovascular system, anti-inflammatory effects across the entire body, antiviral benefits, and cancer prevention (renal specifically).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also helps metabolize iron more efficiently, so women especially should make sure they consume it often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most notable nutrients per 100 grams:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Manganese &#8211; 60% of RDA<\/li><li>Vitamin B6 &#8211; 55% of RDA<\/li><li>Vitamin C &#8211; 43% of RDA<\/li><li>Copper &#8211; 39% of RDA<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>&nbsp;19.
