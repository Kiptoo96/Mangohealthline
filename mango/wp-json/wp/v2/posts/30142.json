makes others have to fight to lose an inch?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you guessed <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">genetics<\/span>, you&#8217;re on the right track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It turns out that your body type\u2014also known as your metabolic ID\u2014plays a huge role in how your body processes food, and how and where it stores fat.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while you can&#8217;t change the metabolic ID you have, you can learn to make the most of what you&#8217;ve got.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we found the best <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/weight-loss-tips\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weight loss tips<\/a> for each of the three main metabolic ID types, so you can finally tap into your own natural leanness (and learn what it is that helps other people win the all-you-can-eat lottery!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s talk about what your metabolic ID type is, and why it matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is a Metabolic ID?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Metabolic ID type was first studied in the 1940s as a way of classifying body size and shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has since evolved into a more precise measurement system to help figure out health factors related to your body\u2019s composition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially, metabolic ID is determined using several measurements of different areas of the body; but <strong>most people can figure out their type by doing a simple self-assessment<\/strong> based on the common traits of each body type.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important information you will get from learning your metabolic ID is <strong>how your body processes food.<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.precisionnutrition.com\/all-about-body-type-eating\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is incredibly important because it will help you to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Choose the foods that your body best responds to<\/li><li>Avoid the foods that your body poorly responds to<\/li><li>Look out for other potential health pitfalls<\/li><li>Maximize your dieting and weight loss efforts.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider it a nutrition label of sorts for your body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially helpful if <strong>you\u2019ve been trying to lose weight for a while, and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/common-reasons-cant-lose-weight\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">nothing is working<\/span><\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might just be eating the wrong foods for your metabolic type\u2014and changing a few simple things can make all the difference!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The 3 Most Common Metabolic ID and Body Types<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div
