It\u2019s easy to fall into a hedonistic snack fest when you can\u2019t find anything better to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The worst part is, when we&#8217;re bored, <em>we often convince ourselves that we are hungry when we are actually NOT.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might not be the worst thing if we snacked on carrots or apples when we were bored, but who does that? <em>Ever&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boredom eating gives the pleasure centers in our brains some instant gratification because <strong>our bored selves like to graze on empty calorie foods like sweets or chips.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrots just don&#8217;t give us that same &#8220;entertainment&#8221; factor that junk food does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Using food for any reason other than putting nutrients into your body can lead you into a cycle of overeating.<\/strong> It can easily become a bad habit like smoking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any bad habit, <strong>you can make a conscious decision to <em>redirect your focus<\/em> towards something that will feed your soul instead of your belly<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Are you ready to stop boredom eating for good?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why We Get Bored<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The German psychologist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/23493-why-we-get-bored.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Theodore Lipps<\/a> came up with a great reason for why we get bored. He said,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Boredom is a feeling of unpleasure arising out of a conflict between a need for intense mental activity and lack of incitement to it, or inability to be incited.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, <strong>we get bored because we LONG for something<\/strong>. We desperately need something to happen, but we have no idea what we want, so we shut down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grabbing a donut or scarfing down a box of crackers is at least <em>SOMETHING<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a physical level, eating releases endorphins, which make us feel good, and dopamine, which stimulates reward\/motivation behavior. We don\u2019t really want those potato chips, <em>we just want to feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You don\u2019t need <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/james-clear\/breaking-habits_b_3540148.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>willpower<\/strong><\/a><strong> to stop boredom eating, you just need a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">mindset change<\/span><\/strong>, which is way easier than trying to force yourself not to do something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.

If you&#8217;re at the office, take a trip to a nearby coffee shop and grab some coffee or tea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Once you know when your impulse to nosh gets turned on, you can find healthy alternatives to eating.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Schedule All Your Eating, Including Snacks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Snacking and eating outside of regular mealtimes can put a huge damper on your diet. So can <a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/time-restricted-eating\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">skipping meals<\/a> because when you\u2019re both hungry and bored, it\u2019s a deadly combo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will sabotage your calorie count faster than you can say \u201c<em>Goodbye weight-loss plan!<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you schedule the times you\u2019re going to eat every day, it makes it much easier to be aware of what you\u2019re putting into your body<\/strong>. <strong>You become more mindful and in control of food intake.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of what we teach in our<a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> 21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/span><\/a>. You can schedule out 3-4 meals\/day based on whatever fits YOUR schedule to prevent snacking and extra, empty calories during the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cutting down on the number of times you eat a day also <strong>saves you time and energy by cutting down the number of decisions you make every day.<\/strong> This frees up your time to focus on the other aspects of your life that matter a lot more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The desperate need for late-night snack-a-thons will also happen less because your newfound healthy eating cycle keeps you from getting hungry at weird hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Replace Bad Habits with Good Ones<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s time to do a little brainstorming. Get a piece of paper and list the things you could be doing instead of eating. Think of things that might be fun, feed your soul, be good for you, and can fit in with your situation or mood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Change can be a blast if you let it be!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re sitting at your desk, maybe you could take a quick walk or do some&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/office-yoga-at-your-desk\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">office yoga<\/a>. Finding something to do that keeps your hands busy, like knitting, coloring, a puzzle, or solitaire can also keep the munchie monsters at bay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, use the time you have to feed your soul. Read an <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/books-for-weight-loss-motivation\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">inspiring book,<\/span><\/a> paint a picture, or write something. <strong>A great way to fill your time instead of eating is writing your thoughts and feelings in a journal.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many popular blogs out there that people started to chronicle their weight loss journey. You can also do a quick <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/hFcQpNr_KA4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">breathing meditation<\/a> that will not only keep you busy but relax you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/woman-walking-to-lose-weight.jpg\" alt=\"woman walking to lose weight and stop boredom eating\" class=\"wp-image-7542\" title=\"woman walking to lose weight and stop boredom eating\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/woman-walking-to-lose-weight.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/woman-walking-to-lose-weight-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/woman-walking-to-lose-weight-365x242.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Go for a walk! None of us get enough walking in these days, or enough Vitamin D for that matter. <em>Phone that friend you&#8217;ve been putting off for a while!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t paint yourself into a pleasure corner. <strong>You should never rely on only one or two things for enjoyment.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s probably one of the reasons that you find yourself bored to begin with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chose a variety of activities to keep you busy so your <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/build-healthy-habits-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">new healthy habits<\/span><\/a> don\u2019t become monotonous.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Create a Food-Free Zone<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We can be really habitual about <em>WHERE<\/em> we feed our bottomless pit of a belly. <em>Maybe we always snack at our desk at work, in the car, or on the couch in front of the TV.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Just like certain activities can trigger us to want to eat, so can certain places<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create spaces in your work and home that are <strong>food-free zones,<\/strong> and swear to yourself that you\u2019ll never eat in those places, including meals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in the habit of snacking or eating lunch at your computer, try only eating in the break room or out of the office. If you find yourself always nibbling at something on the sofa, only eat at the dining room table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are anything like me, this will also help keep your house and personal areas much cleaner! I&#8217;m a crumb-dropper, for sure &#8211; especially when I&#8217;m eating in front of the computer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Make Sure Your Other Needs are Being Met<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Could you be eating for reasons other than boredom?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you\u2019re tired and need some energy, you\u2019re stressed out, or upset about something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you decide that it\u2019s time for a tasty treat outside of a meal, take a few minutes to <strong>check in with yourself. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How are you feeling? What were you thinking or doing right before you got the munchies?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you comforting yourself? <strong>For many of us, food is love<\/strong> and a way that we make ourselves better when we aren\u2019t happy with something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that you\u2019re taking care of those parts of you that need a little extra love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are boredom eating or binge eating more often than you&#8217;d like, it could be the sign of a serious underlying problem. It&#8217;s important to get rid of or at least limit these bad habits in your life and replace them with healthy ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is exactly what our <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/strong><\/span><\/a> was designed for.
