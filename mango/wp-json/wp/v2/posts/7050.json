Sure, some people are far more flexible than others and can perform certain poses that others cannot. &nbsp;But it&#8217;s not about that. &nbsp;It&#8217;s about <strong>pushing and challenging your own body in new ways.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You are your only limit,<\/strong> so make sure&nbsp;to keep yourself open to the wonderful things that you can do with a yoga practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are tips that&nbsp;may be helpful to keep in mind while you are beginning or progressing with your practice:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Widen your stance.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most poses call for your feet to be hip-width apart. For people with a bigger body, it may actually help to have your feet a little wider apart. &nbsp;This can help you increase your balance and stability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experiment with it. &nbsp;Try poses both ways, and find where your feet are the most comfortable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Listen to your body.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel uncomfortable or feel your skin stretching or getting in the way, adjust&nbsp;in the way that you need to and move on. Most yoga poses and instructions are designed to keep bones and muscles in alignment. &nbsp;They don&#8217;t account for extra skin or fat on the body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Feel free to deviate from the instructions when you see fit<\/em>. &nbsp;If you need to readjust to realign yourself in a different way to feel more comfortable, definitely do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Be mindful of your weight.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We mean this in the sense that having more weight to carry can make certain poses more difficult. &nbsp;For example, arm balances will require more strength from you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an instructor says to hold Crow pose (an arm balance) for 30 seconds, make sure to listen to your own body and strength and stop when necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wrists are&nbsp;very delicate and also very vital to your yoga practice. &nbsp;<strong>An injury could set you back weeks or worse.&nbsp;<\/strong>Be mindful of the strength that is required for what you are doing, and work on practicing every day to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-workout-routines-for-toning-muscles\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">build up that strength.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up on the list of yoga tips for anyone with a bigger body is&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Stretch more.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/stretch-more-with-yoga.jpg\" alt=\"stretch more with yoga\" class=\"wp-image-7565\" title=\"stretch more with yoga\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/stretch-more-with-yoga.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/stretch-more-with-yoga-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/stretch-more-with-yoga-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you may have a little more difficulty moving your body in certain ways, make sure you <strong>stretch frequently<\/strong>. Flexibility is a huge part of yoga, and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/get-flexible-fast-yoga\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increased flexibility<\/a> will help you move your body in the right direction and reach the ground easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help you from putting too much strain on the rest of your body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Take it slow.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you go at your own pace. &nbsp;Excess weight can make it more difficult to keep up with others and may make breathing a little more difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some poses, such as wheel pose, are very labor-intensive and make most people very out of breath when they practice them. &nbsp;This is especially the case when you start out, and your body is not used to them. &nbsp;Keep this in mind when you are practicing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen to your body, and rest when you need to. &nbsp;Never stop challenging yourself, but know when your body needs rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Use Props.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/yoga-strap-and-blocks.jpg\" alt=\"yoga strap and blocks\" class=\"wp-image-7540\" title=\"yoga strap and blocks\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/yoga-strap-and-blocks.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/yoga-strap-and-blocks-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/yoga-strap-and-blocks-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This really goes for anyone, but it can be even more useful if you have excess weight to work around. &nbsp;<strong>Do not shy away from using props.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can&#8217;t reach the ground, use a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B008R6WRFU\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fitincol-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B008R6WRFU&amp;linkId=536b07654948308c6adb0618d917861c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">yoga block<\/a>. &nbsp;If you can&#8217;t touch your toes, use a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00XB0DP5I\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fitincol-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00XB0DP5I&amp;linkId=4fbf38811ef08316db4e50fa4a985463\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">yoga strap<\/a>. &nbsp;It&#8217;s better to perform the poses with a block or a strap than to skip them altogether.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Props serve as a helpful tool to use while you build the strength and flexibility to move on without them. &nbsp;They can be an invaluable tool in your practice if you let them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Be positive.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga is just as much a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>mental exercise<\/strong><\/span> as it is a physical one. &nbsp;Just having a positive mindset going into it and during it will make a huge impact on your practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will help you fight the feelings of <em>&#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8221;<\/em> or <em>&#8220;That&#8217;s not for me.&#8221;<\/em> &nbsp;It will help turn those thoughts into <em>&#8220;I can do that!&#8221;<\/em> or <em>&#8220;Let me try that!&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a moment to stop moving, breathe deeply, and concentrate on why you are on your mat and what you want to accomplish. &nbsp;<strong>Visualize your goals<\/strong>, whether it&#8217;s flexibility, strength, to be stress-free, pain-free, etc. &nbsp;Take a moment to visualize what that looks like for you, and use that focus to better your practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Track your progress.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially important if you struggle with frustration or doubts about yoga and what you are capable of. &nbsp;Using a journal or an Instagram account to&nbsp;track your progress can be&nbsp;an invaluable tool in your journey if you let it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Instagram<\/strong> is the best option because there is no better proof than what a photo can show (especially because yoga is so visual). &nbsp;It will also serve to inspire you. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t worry; you can set your account to private if you&#8217;d like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Remember that the limit does not exist.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/sky-is-the-limit.jpg\" alt=\"the sky is the limit\" class=\"wp-image-7564\" title=\"the sky is the limit\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/sky-is-the-limit.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/sky-is-the-limit-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/sky-is-the-limit-365x244.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no limits for others, and there are none for you either. &nbsp;<em><strong>You are your only limit.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your muscles operate in the same way as everyone else&#8217;s. &nbsp;Continue to challenge yourself, and you will continue to push past any preconceived notions or imaginary limits that you once had.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will continue to progress with yoga, and you will find that the poses that once seemed impossible now feel very easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>10. Find the right program.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several options that you have when beginning or progressing with your yoga practice. &nbsp;There are all sorts of classes, videos, and books on the many types of yoga. &nbsp;They will range in age, flexibility, strength, body type, skill level, instruction, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With a wealth of health and fitness information out there, it can be difficult, frustrating, and overwhelming trying to decide what program is right for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is exactly why I&nbsp;designed a&nbsp;program to be for beginners and people of all ages, flexibility, ailments, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our&nbsp;program, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Yoga Fat Loss Bible for Beginners<\/a><\/strong>,<\/span> is all-encompassing, with<strong> 50 fat-burning yoga poses, a complete flexibility guide with beginner modifications, a 6-week workout plan, a beginner&#8217;s guide to meditation, and much more.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"258\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Avocadu-Yoga-Fat-Loss-Bible.png\" alt=\"Avocadu Yoga Fat Loss Bible\" class=\"wp-image-26019\" title=\"Avocadu Yoga Fat Loss Bible\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Avocadu-Yoga-Fat-Loss-Bible.png 600w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Avocadu-Yoga-Fat-Loss-Bible-300x129.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Avocadu-Yoga-Fat-Loss-Bible-365x157.png 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Avocadu-Yoga-Fat-Loss-Bible-355x153.png 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We designed it so that you can learn all about yoga, which poses are for you, and so that you can <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">go at your own pace<\/a><\/strong><\/span> with your practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also includes many beginner modifications that will help you progress over time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/yogafatlossbible.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Click here to check out the Yoga Fat Loss Bible!<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoyed this article on yoga tips for anyone with a bigger body or have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment below!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The most beautiful thing about yoga is that ANYONE can do it!
