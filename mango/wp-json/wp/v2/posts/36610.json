But sometimes, we need to give them a little extra TLC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strength training, ladies, is like giving your body a VIP pass to feeling even more fabulous. It&#8217;s not just for the guys; it\u2019s like a secret weapon us women have in our back pocket.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Three Musketeers of Calorie Burning<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first, let\u2019s chat about <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/womens-metabolism-and-weight-loss\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"36362\">metabolism<\/a>. Picture it like a cozy fire that&#8217;s always burning in your fireplace. Sometimes it&#8217;s just flickering, and other times it&#8217;s a roaring blaze. It&#8217;s all about how much fuel you add! And here are the three BFF\u2019s that keep that fire going:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)<\/strong> &#8211; This is like the embers keeping the fire alive, even when you\u2019re not adding any wood. Imagine chilling on your couch all day binge-watching Netflix. BMR is the calories your body burns just to keep the basics running, like breathing and making sure your heart is doing its thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)<\/strong> &#8211; Every time you eat, it\u2019s like throwing a log into the fire. Your body uses energy to break down that yummy food and absorb nutrients. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.revolution-pts.com\/blog\/understanding-the-thermic-effect-of-food\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.revolution-pts.com\/blog\/understanding-the-thermic-effect-of-food\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TEF<\/a> is that extra energy used, or the sparks that fly when you add that log!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Physical Activity Energy Expenditure (PAEE)<\/strong> &#8211; This one\u2019s the fire when you really get it roaring. It\u2019s all about the calories burned when you\u2019re moving and shaking. Dancing in the kitchen? Check. Chasing after the bus? Double-check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Strength Training: Firestarter Extraordinaire<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-leg-press-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Role of Strength Training in Women's Weight Loss leg press\" class=\"wp-image-36620\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-leg-press-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-leg-press-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-leg-press-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-leg-press-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-leg-press.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So how does strength training fit into all of this? It\u2019s like the ultimate firestarter for your metabolism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Building Lean Muscle Mass<\/strong> &#8211; More muscle means more calories burned, even when you\u2019re just hanging out. It\u2019s like upgrading from a tiny fireplace to a massive bonfire. The more muscle you have, the bigger your BMR gets!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. The Afterburn Effect (EPOC)<\/strong> &#8211; Here&#8217;s a cool term: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acefitness.org\/resources\/pros\/expert-articles\/5008\/7-things-to-know-about-excess-post-exercise-oxygen-consumption-epoc\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/www.acefitness.org\/resources\/pros\/expert-articles\/5008\/7-things-to-know-about-excess-post-exercise-oxygen-consumption-epoc\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Excess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption<\/a>. Okay, I know, it sounds fancy. But think of it like this: after a strength workout, your body turns into a calorie-burning machine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;It&#8217;s working extra hard to recover, and that means burning more calories even after you&#8217;ve finished your last rep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Happy Hormones and Muscle Magic<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>And hey, strength training is not just about muscles and calories, it\u2019s also a hormone whisperer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Becoming Friends with Insulin<\/strong> &#8211; By strength training, you help your body use <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/how-exercise-can-reverse-insulin-resistance\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"31912\">insulin<\/a> better, which is great for keeping blood sugars in check. And balanced blood sugar means fewer energy crashes and less fat storage. Score!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Muscle-Building Hormones<\/strong> &#8211; Your body has some natural helpers, like testosterone and growth hormone, which are all about building muscle and burning fat. Strength training gives them a high five and gets them super pumped to help you out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strength training is basically like having a secret potion for turning your body into a lean, mean, calorie-burning machine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Debunking Myths Surrounding Women and Strength Training<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-weighted-lunges.jpg\" alt=\"Role of Strength Training in Women's Weight Loss weighted lunges\" class=\"wp-image-36625\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a bunch of misinformation floating around out there, especially when it comes to women and weights. It&#8217;s high time we set the record straight and kick those pesky myths to the curb!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Myth 1: Strength Training = Bulkiness<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Ladies, let&#8217;s get this straight \u2013 lifting weights won&#8217;t turn you into a muscle-bound figure. It&#8217;s a common worry, but here&#8217;s the science: we women generally have less testosterone than men.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/womens-health\/do-women-have-testosterone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Testosterone<\/a> is that hormone that helps in building big muscles. So, for us, strength training usually leads to toned muscles and a sleek physique, not bulkiness. Plus, being strong is pretty awesome, isn\u2019t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Myth 2: Cardio is King, Weights are Optional<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve all heard that if you want to lose weight, endless cardio is the way to go. But let\u2019s hit the pause button on that. Cardio is great, but strength training is like the unsung hero of fitness.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you build muscle through strength training, your body burns more calories even when you&#8217;re just living your life. That&#8217;s because muscles are like little calorie-furnaces that raise your basal metabolic rate (BMR).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in the long game, <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/strength-training-for-weight-loss-and-body-composition\/\">strength training can be a superstar for weight loss<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-dumbbells-free-weights-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Role of Strength Training in Women's Weight Loss dumbbells free weights\" class=\"wp-image-36617\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-dumbbells-free-weights-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-dumbbells-free-weights-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-dumbbells-free-weights-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-dumbbells-free-weights-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Role-of-Strength-Training-in-Womens-Weight-Loss-dumbbells-free-weights.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Myth 3: Strength Training is a Fast Track to Injury<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing some people worry about is getting hurt. Now, let\u2019s get real &#8211; any form of exercise, if done wrong, can cause injury. But here\u2019s the kicker: strength training, when done right, is actually a guardian angel for your body.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It strengthens not just your muscles, but also the connective tissues. This means your body becomes more injury-resistant.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With proper technique and guidance, strength training is not just safe; it&#8217;s a body\u2019s best friend in reducing the risk of injuries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Strength Training Beyond Weight Loss<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, we&#8217;ve been chatting about how strength training is a champ for weight loss.

Say Hello to Mighty Bones<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, strength training is a bestie for your bones. By putting a little resistance on those bones through lifting weights, you\u2019re telling them, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s get stronger!&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is super important, especially for us ladies because as we age, we&#8217;re more likely to face bone issues like osteoporosis.

Rocking It in Daily Life<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the deal \u2013 when you\u2019re strong, everyday tasks feel like a breeze. Carrying groceries? Easy peasy. Climbing stairs? No problemo!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strength training tunes up your muscles so that they\u2019re ready to help you zip through your daily to-do list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Confidence Level: Infinity<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Last, but definitely not least, is the confidence boost. Strength training has this amazing side effect: it makes you feel empowered and good about your body.
