Instead, focus on consuming lots of high-quality fats.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Implement these foods into your life on an almost daily basis, and you will notice big changes in how you look and feel almost immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Low carb veggies, DONE RIGHT<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/healthy-low-carb-roasted-vegetables-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"healthy low carb roasted vegetables to lose weight\" class=\"wp-image-5496\" title=\"healthy low carb roasted vegetables to lose weight\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone knows to eat more vegetables. &nbsp;The problem is that veggies don\u2019t taste very good on their own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, not anymore!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret is simple: Cook the veggies, and add seasonings to them. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you cook veggies in a high-quality oil such as extra virgin&nbsp;olive oil or coconut oil, the taste dramatically increases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do this, and add in a light amount of salt for a healthy and delicious snack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t worry about losing nutrients in the cooking process or anything like that. The fact that you will be getting in regular sources of vegetables far outweighs the minimal amount of nutrients lost in the cooking process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Soaked Oats<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/soaked-oats-for-breakfast-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"soaked oats for a healthy breakfast to help you lose weight fast\" class=\"wp-image-5484\" title=\"soaked oats for a healthy breakfast to help you lose weight fast\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>As stated before, if your goal is FAST weight loss, you want to be easy on the carbohydrates at the beginning of any <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/21-day-diet-challenge-weigh-200-lbs\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weight loss plan.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this food absolutely deserved a place on this list, because it\u2019s high in fiber and will help prevent energy crashes throughout the&nbsp;day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soak the oats in unsweetened cashew and almond milk, add in a little cinnamon for flavor, and voil\u00e0! You have a healthy low-calorie energy boost and great source of carbohydrates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend using this only after you have done a low carbohydrate detox and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/insulin-resistance-and-weight-loss\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reset your insulin levels.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Avocados<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The third food on the delicious foods that help you lose weight is probably one of the greatest foods on the planet for high-quality fats, fiber, folic acid, and taste (and the inspiration for the&nbsp;website name).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avocados are equally healthy as they are delicious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are one of the few high-fat fruits that are loaded with fiber to help you feel full and satiated after your meals. You can eat them alongside almost any breakfast item, throw them in a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/the-simple-green-smoothie-recipe\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smoothie<\/a>, or make fresh guacamole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an easy chart to help understand when they are ripe:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/how-to-tell-if-an-avocado-is-ripe.jpg\" alt=\"how to tell if an avocado is ripe\" class=\"wp-image-5501\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/how-to-tell-if-an-avocado-is-ripe.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/how-to-tell-if-an-avocado-is-ripe-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/how-to-tell-if-an-avocado-is-ripe-365x242.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a simple technique you can use at any store, but remember\u2026 you only get one shot to check!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.

This is because it helps to keep you full and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/stop-binge-eating-and-emotional-eating\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eliminate cravings<\/a> without adding in a crazy amount of calories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, most people are under the impression that chicken is always bland and boring. Not so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lean chicken breast seasoned with cajun seasoning, turmeric, and black pepper makes for a delicious meal that will also help you lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5.

However, you can pair the shake with the next food on my&nbsp;list\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Apples<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/delicious-and-healthy-apples-in-a-bowl-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"delicious and healthy apples in a bowl\" class=\"wp-image-5489\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple, healthy, and delicious, there\u2019s no way I&nbsp;could avoid putting apples on this list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apples contain antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and pectin, which has been shown to greatly reduce hunger cravings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you feel like you need a break or a snack, reach for an apple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is also to find which apple YOU love best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people love green apples and others, like myself, love Fuji. Find the kind that you think is delicious, and eat them daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t worry about the type, because they will all have very similar nutrient profiles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7.
