Researchers believe that wild salmon get their omega-3 from eating algae. Unfortunately, most farmed raised salmon are fed fish meal, so they have less omega-3 than their wild cousins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Olive Oil<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is such a thing as good fat, and extra virgin olive oil has it.

It helps <strong>reduce joint inflammation and cartilage damage.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re worried about using olive oil on your veggies, don\u2019t be. It might be high in fat, but it\u2019s monounsaturated, which promotes weight loss. <em>Just don&#8217;t go too crazy with it, because it is still high in calories!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>10. Black Beans<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When black beans ferment in your belly, your healthy gut bacteria turns it into the fatty acid butyrate, which is a serious inflammation buster. They\u2019re also<strong> loaded with antioxidants that help fight free radicals and regulate insulin.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/how-to-reduce-belly-bloat-and-keep-it-off\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Bloated belly people<\/span><\/a> beware; black beans are <strong>high in fiber and some people can difficulty digesting them.<\/strong> If you find that you get gassy or bloated when you eat too much fiber, steer clear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make this a compliment sandwich, one last awesome benefit of black beans is that they are a great <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/17-iron-rich-foods-how-to-know-youre-deficient\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">plant-based source of iron!<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>11.

Dark Chocolate<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s true that chocolate is really good for you, but don\u2019t get too excited yet. It\u2019s only a certain kind, and it\u2019s <em>not<\/em> creamy and filled with processed sugar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dark chocolate, the kind that tastes a little bitter, has compounds that shut down the genes <strong>linked to inflammation and insulin resistance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2ARkWUz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">cacao content of at least 70%<\/a><\/span> in your next sweet treat because it will contain the highest amounts of healing antioxidants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>14.
