It\u2019s almost like our body gives up on us, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>After age 40, it\u2019s more like our body needs to find new ways to work properly.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it as a new body and deal with it head-on. Like, <em>\u201cOkay, body, what do we need to work on today to get you to where you need to be?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sure, there will be a lot of tweaking after 40 to figure out what your body needs from <em>you<\/em> to keep the extra weight off.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, it can be done when we learn about the 40-year-old body and take the right steps to put it back on track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Get to Know Your Body<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first: <strong><em>You need to understand your new body<\/em>. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This takes time, and that\u2019s okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A woman\u2019s body after 40 usually needs different nutrition and exercise to keep it going than it did when you were in your 30s.<\/strong> And, <em>you&nbsp;<\/em>have<em>&nbsp;<\/em>likely changed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spend some time getting to know yourself and your body. What still works in the losing weight department and what doesn\u2019t work as well?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your body may not be able to handle a mile-long run for daily exercise anymore, but yoga may be both calming for you and <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/yoga-workout-routines-for-toning-muscles\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">toning for your body.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did three cups of coffee in the morning never seem to influence your weight gain before? Try cutting back to one or two cups and see if your weight goes down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems simple, but the point is this: <strong>CHANGE THINGS UP!&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this discovery process, you may be able to pinpoint some trends in your weight gain and loss to help you more effectively target problem areas through your 40s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Get Plenty of Sleep<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/trouble-sleeping-1.jpg\" alt=\"trouble sleeping\" class=\"wp-image-29106\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/trouble-sleeping-1.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/trouble-sleeping-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/trouble-sleeping-1-365x242.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/trouble-sleeping-1-355x235.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/condition-article\/0,,20218561,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Health<\/a>, <strong>sleep problems tend to begin in our 40s. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may find yourself tossing and turning at night, not being able to avoid naps during the day, or waking up extremely early in the morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lack of sleep can directly impact your weight loss.<\/strong> Sleep issues can come from medications, underlying health problems, stress, and numerous other factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re having trouble getting a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/health-benefits-of-sleep\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full night\u2019s sleep,<\/a> check with your doctor first.
