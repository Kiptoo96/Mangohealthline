However, this can vary depending on how much coffee you consume and your individual sensitivity to caffeine. Some people may find that they feel the effects of coffee for much longer than 5 hours. If you find that you are particularly sensitive to caffeine, it is best to limit your intake to avoid feeling jittery or anxious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much coffee is too much?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e3fd2fbd-4e4c-4dad-9aa9-4dcdb687f69d\">There is no definitive answer to this question as everyone metabolizes caffeine differently. However, most experts agree that consuming more than 400 mg of caffeine per day (about 4 cups of coffee per day) can lead to side effects such as insomnia, anxiety, and restlessness. If you find that you are particularly sensitive to caffeine, it is best to limit your caffeine intake to avoid these side effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What happens if you drink coffee everyday?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ca4c2016-7da5-4307-81bb-b27a4898d0a0\">If you drink coffee every day, you may develop a tolerance to the caffeine. This means that you will need to consume more caffeine to achieve the same effect. Additionally, you may find that you suffer from side effects such as headaches, irritability, and nervousness if you go without coffee for even a day or two. If you find that you need to drink coffee every day to function, it is best to consult a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can coffee cause weight gain?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"ca4c2016-7da5-4307-81bb-b27a4898d0a0\">Coffee itself is calorie-free. However, many people add sugar, cream, or other high-calorie toppings to their coffee which can lead to weight gain. If you are trying to lose weight, it is best to avoid adding these toppings to your coffee. Additionally, it is important to be mindful of the number of calories you consume from other sources throughout the day as too many calories can lead to weight gain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is drinking decaffeinated coffee better for you?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1899d239-548b-4e73-9027-dffde4dffd0b\">Decaffeinated coffee still contains small amounts of caffeine. However, it is generally safe for most people to consume in moderation. If you are sensitive to caffeine or suffer from anxiety, it is best to avoid decaffeinated coffee as it may still contain enough caffeine to cause side effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What should I do if I get the coffee jitters?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8f35df07-89a7-4d08-b849-e5e28afbb8db\">If you find that you are particularly sensitive to caffeine, it is best to limit your intake to avoid feeling jittery or anxious. Additionally, drinking coffee on an empty stomach can also lead to the coffee jitters. If this happens, it is best to eat a light snack before consuming coffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"65ded9f2-0531-41d8-8464-850a9c48c0e8\">In conclusion, coffee has a variety of effects on the body, both good and bad. However, it is important to be mindful of your caffeine intake to avoid potential side effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related Articles<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-weight-mushroom-coffee\/\">How To Lose Weight &amp; Increase Energy By Switching To Mushroom Coffee<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/iced-coffee-protein-shake-recipes-weight-loss\/\">Top 8 Iced Coffee Protein Shake Recipes for Weight Loss<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/10-proven-health-benefits-of-coffee\/\">10 Proven Health Benefits of Coffee<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"591\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Effects-of-Coffee-on-the-Body-5-591x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Effects of Coffee on the Body\" class=\"wp-image-36854\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Effects-of-Coffee-on-the-Body-5-591x1024.jpg 591w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Effects-of-Coffee-on-the-Body-5-173x300.jpg 173w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Effects-of-Coffee-on-the-Body-5-768x1331.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Effects-of-Coffee-on-the-Body-5-886x1536.jpg 886w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Effects-of-Coffee-on-the-Body-5-1182x2048.jpg 1182w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Effects-of-Coffee-on-the-Body-5-150x260.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Effects-of-Coffee-on-the-Body-5-scaled.jpg 1477w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I love coffee myself, and couldn&#8217;t survive without my morning cup of joe.
