You probably already know this if you\u2019ve ever struggled to lose weight, experienced a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/weight-loss-plateau\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weight loss plateau<\/a> or seen the pounds creep on over the years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other factors contribute to weight gain or difficulty losing it, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Hormonal imbalances<\/li><li>Stress<\/li><li>Adrenal fatigue<\/li><li>Toxins in the system<\/li><li>Insulin resistance<\/li><li>An <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/unhealthy-gut-warning-signs\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unhealthy gut<\/a><\/li><li>Metabolic issues<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can eat salads all day long, but if you don\u2019t take care of yourself in other ways, you may not achieve your body goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoga is one way to get <strong>back in touch with your body<\/strong> and target some of the above factors that can interfere with weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use Yoga to Detox<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While studies show that yoga doesn\u2019t directly help you detox, the practice can help <strong>boost circulation and improve your lymphatic system.<\/strong>&nbsp;Essentially, yoga can help your body <strong>improve its own detoxification system.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your body is able to <strong>eliminate more harmful waste from the system,<\/strong> it operates like it\u2019s supposed to. That means that your body can <strong>absorb nutrients better and use food for fuel more effectively.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your body can respond to insulin the way it\u2019s supposed to instead of<strong> allowing sugar to accumulate in the blood and affect the organs.<\/strong> Your body can release the <strong>proper balance of hormones<\/strong> to help with all functions, including weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use Yoga to Shred<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do all the gentle yoga you want, but if you have a <strong>significant amount of fat to lose,<\/strong> you may not see the defined muscle tone that you want until you get rid of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You don\u2019t have to do massive amounts of cardio to lose the fat, either.<\/strong> Researchers are finding that doing shorter bouts (8-16 minutes a day) of high-intensity exercise may be just as effective as jogging for 30 minutes (<a href=\"http:\/\/jap.physiology.org\/content\/111\/6\/1540.short\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research also shows that HIIT training increases the body\u2019s ability to burn fat (<a href=\"http:\/\/ajpendo.physiology.org\/content\/299\/2\/E180.short\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, people tend to view this kind of training as <strong>more enjoyable<\/strong> and less boring than longer bouts of steady cardio, making them <strong>more motivated<\/strong> to actually do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How can you add more fire into your yoga practice to burn more fat and lose weight?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can incorporate moves that involve doing yoga poses in a <strong>more intense manner or with faster repetitions.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The moves below are not specific yoga poses, but they are still <strong>bodyweight exercises<\/strong> and therefore very close to yoga.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some ideas for adding intensity to your yoga routine:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Do plank pose with mini-pushups.<\/strong> Bending and straightening your elbows just an inch while keeping them close to your sides for a minute can tone your arms and shoulders and increase your heart rate before you know what hit you.<\/li><li><strong>Do mountain climbers for a minute. <\/strong>With yoga, you don\u2019t necessarily have to move faster to get your heart rate up.
