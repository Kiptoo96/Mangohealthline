Most of us who have dieted or tried to make lifestyle changes around food, have done so with a goal in mind, right? At least a fairly general goal&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;10 pounds, 20 pounds, etc.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fff47d;\"><strong>Bullet Journals are a great tool to use for setting goals and tracking your habits &#8212; in an <em>organized<\/em> manner (i.e. better than a mental or sticky pad note).<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s long been said that <strong>writing down your goals can make you more accountable and often improves your performance. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear goals can also help you <em>focus<\/em> and avoid distractions. They can make it easier to get through the <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/weight-loss-plateau\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">weight loss plateaus<\/span><\/a>, the cravings, and the days that leave you wanting to binge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Andrea Bonior, who has a B.A. &nbsp;in Psychology from Yale and a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from American University, is the voice behind the column Baggage Check in the Washington Post (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/people\/dr-andrea-bonior\/?utm_term=.2325843f332b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She states that<strong><em> \u201cJust the act of writing things down might make us change our behavior.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could the mere step of writing our goals down and focusing on them really make it easier to attain them? Could creating and implementing a weight loss bullet journal really help you lose weight?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say it\u2019s certainly worth a try!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a good reason why weight loss bullet journals have become something of a phenomenon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many have taken the core concepts of the journal and started using one to keep track of their health or weight loss goals while keeping a log of things like their daily water intake, how many steps they\u2019ve walked in a day, and depending on how they diet, things like number of calories or carbs they\u2019ve consumed in a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Bonior, mentioned above, states that<strong><em> \u201cBullet journals lend an air of structure and organization that can feel comforting and allow us to view things more easily at a glance.\u201d<\/em> <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Steps to Creating a Weight Loss Bullet Journal <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I shared a video above of the original bullet concept, but here is one that was done <strong>specifically for weight loss:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/8f5g2Dsa5M4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not something you need to follow religiously, as she has incorporated quite a diverse assortment of workouts, and that may not interest you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is more so that you have a <strong>visual<\/strong> of what I\u2019m suggesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fff47d;\"><strong>There are no hard and fast rules when designing your bullet journal. It should be designed with YOU and your goals in mind!<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can make it look pretty if you want or make it look simple and straight-forward &#8212; just like your goals!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whatever works for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, start off by <strong>defining your goals:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>How many pounds do you want to lose?<\/em><\/li><li><em>How many inches would you like to lose?<\/em><\/li><li><em>Do you have a timeframe you want to achieve these goals in?<\/em><\/li><li><em>How much do you want to increase your activity?<\/em><\/li><li><em>What activities do you want to add?<\/em><\/li><li><em>What foods do you want to start including in your diet?<\/em><\/li><li><em>What foods do you want to start excluding from your diet?<\/em><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are a few goals to get you started. And maybe that\u2019s more goals than you can handle. If so, that\u2019s okay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pick a few that are most important to you and set them as your personal goals.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fff47d;\"><strong>Remember that setting too many goals at once can drain and overwhelm you. Consider starting small with 1-2 simple goals and working towards adding more as you move along.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people say that it takes around 30 days to build a good, strong habit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try setting 1-2 goals for 30 days and then check back in after 30 days and see how you&#8217;re doing. If you&#8217;re still going strong, add another 1-2 new healthy goals to your <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2MNgCwK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">bullet journal!<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could use that as a guideline to craft a weight loss bullet journal to use with our <a href=\"https:\/\/programs.avocadu.com\/p\/21-day-fat-loss-challenge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21 Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Or perhaps create a chart of the foods you want to start avoiding replaced with the foods you should be eating instead.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>There are so many different things you can do!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Setting Actionable Goals <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I mentioned above that starting off with short-term goals may be the way to set goals, but I want to clarify that\u2019s more than a passing suggestion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up a weight-loss bullet journal\u2014or any type of weight loss plan for that matter\u2014should be done in <strong>smaller steps,<\/strong> and the more weight you have to lose, the more important this is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"313\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/journal-for-weight-loss.jpg\" alt=\"journal for weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-29139\" title=\"journal for weight loss\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/journal-for-weight-loss.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/journal-for-weight-loss-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/journal-for-weight-loss-365x228.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/journal-for-weight-loss-355x222.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.
