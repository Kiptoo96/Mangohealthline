My favorite way is to wrap it around a pickle or even pickled asparagus.&nbsp; Yum!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another fantastic on-the-go protein source is the snack packs of <strong>cubed meat and mixed nuts<\/strong> that can be found in the refrigerator section of the grocery store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.
