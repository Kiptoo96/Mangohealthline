These steps will not only help you lose weight, but they will help you <strong>lose weight the RIGHT way.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These principles come from our popular weight loss program, the <a href=\"http:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/span><\/a>.

You&#8217;re not alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a normal part of life to make a few mistakes trying to <strong>get the right system that works for you and your body.<\/strong>&nbsp; I have personally purchased dozens of programs, books, and pills only to find that most of them didn\u2019t work for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn to recognize what is scammy vs. what is actually possible. Look for actual testimonials from real people with real results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Start learning whether your body is actually hungry or just bored.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As humans, we get pleasure from the food we eat, and it has the ability to make us feel happy. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this leads teen girls to do a lot of <strong>overeating<\/strong> from the amount or type of food that is readily available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, you will eat not because you are&nbsp;hungry, but just because you are&nbsp;bored. When we get hungry, we use 2 simple tricks to figuring this out:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Chew sugar-free gum.<\/strong> This will dull the cravings and has also been shown to help relieve stress.<\/li><li><strong>Drink a large glass of ice-cold water<\/strong> and wait for 30 minutes before eating. Most of the time, the cravings will go away and you\u2019ll find the body is not actually hungry at all<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/stop-boredom-eating\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How to Stop Boredom Eating<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

In fact, teens that don\u2019t get 8 hours a night are 50% more likely to be obese than those who do. That\u2019s pretty compelling evidence that you need more sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get 8 hours a night, because your weight depends on it.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5.

Eat a TON of lean protein and veggies.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you\u2019re not eating carbohydrates, what should you be eating?&#8230;&nbsp;<strong>Huge quantities of high-quality lean proteins and loads of low carb vegetables.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The high protein:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Boosts the metabolism by 80-100 calories depending on the meal<\/li><li>Cuts down cravings and desire for sweets<\/li><li>Causes people to eat 441 fewer calories per day<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The low carb veggies:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Provides lots of fiber for better appetite control and satiety<\/li><li>Gives the body precious vitamins and minerals for better overall health<\/li><li>Fills you up with virtually 0 calories<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining these things into meals is the secret to diet success.
