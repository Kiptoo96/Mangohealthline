Maybe losing weight is something you\u2019ve been putting off for awhile or maybe you\u2019ve tried weight loss programs that haven\u2019t given you the results you desire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the case may be, we understand how you\u2019re feeling. Many people, especially women, struggle with losing weight. It doesn\u2019t help that there are so many programs and challenges that exist promising things that simply aren\u2019t true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our culture is full of dangerous diet fads and unhealthy recommendations for rapid weight loss. It can feel so frustrating to want to lose weight, but not knowing where to turn to for something that will deliver.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re asking yourself \u201cshould I do a fat loss challenge?,\u201d you\u2019ve come to the right place.

You\u2019re not motivated.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Unmotivated-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Unmotivated to do a fat loss challenge\" class=\"wp-image-36059\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Unmotivated-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Unmotivated-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Unmotivated-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Unmotivated-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Unmotivated-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start by discussing reasons you shouldn\u2019t do a fat loss challenge. This might surprise you, but the biggest reason you should avoid a fat loss challenge is lack of motivation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cWait a minute! The whole reason I\u2019m here is I was looking for diets to lose weight quickly.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe in honesty, and the truth is if you aren\u2019t fully committed, you will not see results and will only further your frustration on the matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing weight isn\u2019t easy and any program that tells you otherwise is lying to you. You must make a serious commitment to yourself and your physical body before starting a fat loss challenge. You can\u2019t put in just a little bit of effort and expect it to go a long way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. You\u2019re not the one that wants to lose weight.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason you shouldn\u2019t do a fat loss challenge is if your heart isn\u2019t truly in it. This goes along with commitment in that if you aren\u2019t the one who wants the results, you will not achieve the results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever heard the phrase \u201cyou can\u2019t make someone do something they don\u2019t want to do\u201d? The same concept applies to weight loss and should be taken very seriously. You have to be the one that genuinely wants to lose weight in order for that to happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, if you\u2019re doing this because society says women should be thinner or because you\u2019re significant other is making you feel bad about your weight &#8211; now might not be the best time to join our fat loss challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Related: Read our post, \u201c<\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/daily-habits-to-live-a-happier-and-healthier-life\/\"><strong><em>10 Daily Habits to Live a Happier and Healthier Life<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em>\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. You\u2019re not healthy enough to do the challenge<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re concerned about safety and health reasons, that\u2019s completely understandable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we mentioned above, safety is our top priority and we are aware of the many dangerous programs that exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should never participate in a fat loss challenge that asks you to do things that are unhealthy and dangerous. While our program is completely safe and backed by science, we still insist that you visit a healthcare professional before blindly starting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reasons You Should Do a Fat Loss Challenge<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Avocadu 21-day fat loss challenge can result in the fastest weight loss for women. With that in mind, let\u2019s discuss the many reasons you should do a fat loss challenge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. You Owe It To Yourself<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Love-yourself-enough-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Love yourself enough to do a fat loss challenge\" class=\"wp-image-36058\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Love-yourself-enough-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Love-yourself-enough-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Love-yourself-enough-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Love-yourself-enough-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Love-yourself-enough-to-do-a-fat-loss-challenge.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, you owe it to yourself. This is especially true for those of you women who have been wanting to lose weight and have been trying to do so for an extended amount of time but have been unable to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You owe it to yourself and your health to achieve what you desire. We feel our best when we\u2019re comfortable in our bodies, and we should always aim to achieve that comfortability. You want to lose weight and you want to feel more confident and happy in your body, so you should take the leap in making that happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Being Overweight Comes With Health Risks&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason you should participate in a fat loss challenge is for health reasons. We mentioned the dangers of some programs that exist and how they can ask women to lose weight in unhealthy and unsafe ways, but we need to talk about the health risks of having extra weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Do-a-fat-loss-challenge-for-your-health-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Do a fat loss challenge for your health\" class=\"wp-image-36057\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Do-a-fat-loss-challenge-for-your-health-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Do-a-fat-loss-challenge-for-your-health-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Do-a-fat-loss-challenge-for-your-health-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Do-a-fat-loss-challenge-for-your-health-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Do-a-fat-loss-challenge-for-your-health.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>People who fall into the overweight or obese category are at a higher risk for many health issues including many types of cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, mental health problems, and much more. It\u2019s safe to say that being overweight has many adverse health effects that shouldn\u2019t be ignored.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/healthyweight\/losing_weight\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The CDC reported<\/a>, \u201cEven a modest weight loss of 5 to 10 percent of your total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A woman weighing 200 pounds losing 10 pounds in the challenge would achieve that 5 percent weight loss goal!
