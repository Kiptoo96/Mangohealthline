To quell the<strong> diseases and parasites<\/strong> that can run rampant in an <strong>overcrowded fish farm.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If farmed fish escape, they can breed with wild fish, <strong>permanently altering the species.<\/strong> The <strong>abundance of feed and fish waste<\/strong> in the waters also crowds out the oxygen that other aquatic wildlife needs to survive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the feed used in farms is inexpensive and <strong>corn-based.<\/strong> This throws off the <strong>ratio of omega-3s to omega-6s<\/strong> in the fish, making them less healthy for human consumption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Farmed Tilapia<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people claim that eating this popular fish is <strong>worse for your health than eating bacon.<\/strong> (However, just to get one thing clear, bacon isn\u2019t the devil when eaten in moderation and from good sources).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with tilapia is that it is <strong>highly farmed.<\/strong> You\u2019re unlikely to be eating wild-caught tilapia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Wake Forest have discovered that farm-raised tilapia contains <strong>ratios of fatty acids that are actually damaging to your health<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wakehealth.edu\/News-Releases\/2008\/Wake_Forest_Researchers_Say_Popular_Fish_Contains_Potentially_Dangerous_Fatty_Acid_Combination.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Farmed tilapia contains <strong>high levels of omega-6 fatty acids and low levels of omega-3s.<\/strong> This actually <strong>contributes to inflammation<\/strong> instead of reducing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re trying to follow the medical community\u2019s recommendation to eat more fish, you\u2019re not really improving your health by eating more tilapia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Atlantic Salmon<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you search for a fish recipe online, you\u2019ll come up with thousands of delicious-looking options for salmon dishes. However, this common fish is not so great to eat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most <em><strong>Atlantic<\/strong><\/em> salmon comes from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=miFMtgMcX58\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">farms<\/a>. You won\u2019t see wild Atlantic salmon, because it\u2019s actually an <strong>endangered species<\/strong>, explains <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fisheries.noaa.gov\/pr\/species\/fish\/atlantic-salmon.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NOAA Fisheries<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The abundance of Atlantic salmon farms is one of the reasons the wild species is endangered to begin with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The omega-3 levels in Atlantic salmon are 50% lower than they were five years ago,<\/strong> says a 2016 study&nbsp;(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-37321656\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>). Because the anchovy population is dwindling, less of that fish is used to feed the salmon, throwing off the fatty acid ratios.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because farmed salmon don\u2019t get the right nutrients to develop properly, they don\u2019t always get that <strong>rosy glow<\/strong> so characteristic of this type of fish. Therefore, many fish farmers add a <strong>synthetic pigment<\/strong> to the feed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/difference-between-wild-caught-and-farm-raised-salmon.png\" alt=\"difference between wild caught and farm raised salmon\" class=\"wp-image-25560\" title=\"difference between wild caught and farm raised salmon\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/difference-between-wild-caught-and-farm-raised-salmon.png 800w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/difference-between-wild-caught-and-farm-raised-salmon-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/difference-between-wild-caught-and-farm-raised-salmon-768x512.png 768w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/difference-between-wild-caught-and-farm-raised-salmon-365x243.png 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/difference-between-wild-caught-and-farm-raised-salmon-355x237.png 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This about this, y&#8217;all&#8230; Our watermelons are genetically modified to not contain seeds (the NATURAL way that the fruit reproduces), and farm-raised salmon has pigment ADDED <strong>just to make you feel better about eating it.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you see the problem here?

According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/mediacentre\/factsheets\/fs225\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Health Organization<\/a>, dioxins are environmental pollutants that can <strong>cause cancer as well as damage to the immune system, reproductive system and endocrine system.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Genetically engineered salmon is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/AnimalVeterinary\/DevelopmentApprovalProcess\/GeneticEngineering\/GeneticallyEngineeredAnimals\/ucm280853.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">approved for sale by the FDA<\/a>. The product <strong>does not have to be labeled as GMO,<\/strong> so if you\u2019re eating farmed salmon, you really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Chilean Seabass<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a popular item at restaurants and weddings. The real name for this fish is the <a href=\"http:\/\/seafood.edf.org\/chilean-sea-bass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Patagonian or Antarctic toothfish<\/a>, but \u201cChilean seabass\u201d sounds more appetizing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s not so appetizing is that the fish develops slowly, and overfishing has left the species in trouble. It\u2019s <strong>not considered to be an eco-friendly or sustainable fish to eat.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, it does contain <strong>elevated mercury levels.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Grouper<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Grouper contains <strong>elevated mercury levels,<\/strong> and it is recommended that adults eat only two servings of this fish per month. Kids should only eat one, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/seafood.edf.org\/grouper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Environmental Defense Fund<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, an&nbsp;Oceana study reveals that other types of fish may be sold as grouper, making you question what you\u2019re truly eating (<a href=\"http:\/\/oceana.org\/sites\/default\/files\/National_Seafood_Fraud_Testing_Results_Highlights_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My thoughts are this&#8230; If there is a food that is only recommended to be eaten once or twice A MONTH, you are <strong>far better off&nbsp;getting those nutrients from other sources.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5.
