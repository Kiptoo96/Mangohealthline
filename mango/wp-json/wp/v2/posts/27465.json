It\u2019s not new, though. It\u2019s been a <strong>staple of Japanese diets for centuries.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s made from <strong>fermented soybeans<\/strong> that can seem a little, well, <em>exotic<\/em> to our western taste buds. People either love it or hate it, like marmite, Justin Bieber, or Nickelback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Natto tastes okay to most people, but the texture is a little creepy, which is similar to a string bean dipped in snot&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can eat things like raw oysters without hurling (congratulations, you&#8217;re better than I am), then you\u2019re probably not going to have a problem with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It also smells much worse than it tastes<\/strong>.

It\u2019s commonly called blue-green algae.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know it sounds hurl-worthy, but it\u2019s a pretty amazing food source.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does it have high levels of protein in it, but it\u2019s loaded with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Gram per gram, it\u2019s considered by many to be<strong> THE most nutrient-dense food on the planet<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also a <strong>complete protein,<\/strong> which means it has all the essential amino acids in it that we need, while still being low calorie and low fat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to gnaw on raw algae to get your daily protein intake. It comes in<a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2xGHh1e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> powder form<\/span><\/a>, so you can mix it in with juice or a smoothie.
