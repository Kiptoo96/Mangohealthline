Your body gets tricked into thinking you\u2019ve eaten more food than you have because they take more time to digest than other foods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beans and lentils are packed with the stuff, but some people don\u2019t digest them well, which is the cause of their wretched reputation as a belly bloater and gas producer. They\u2019ve got <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/how-to-reduce-antinutrients#section7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">antinutrients<\/a> like tannins and phytic acid that might make you toot more than just your own horn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Soak beans before you cook them<\/strong>, and you\u2019ll be fine.

This makes them turn into a <strong>gel-like substance<\/strong> in your belly, which helps you feel more satiated after you eat. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0023643808001345\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can sprinkle them on <em>anything<\/em>.

It\u2019s got saturated fat in it and stimulants like caffeine and theobromine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for the bars that have at least 70% cacao.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Whole Eggs<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve probably heard that you shouldn\u2019t eat whole eggs because they are high in fat and cholesterol. Well, it&nbsp;has actually been proven that<strong> they have no effect on cholesterol levels and don\u2019t contribute to heart problems<\/strong>. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16340654\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One study found that having an egg for breakfast can enhance weight loss because eggs fill you up and make you want to eat less.

Obese people who did this for a study <strong>lost an average of 3 \u00bd pounds over a 12-week period<\/strong>, just by adding it into their diet. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16579728\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grapefruits also reduce <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/insulin-resistance-and-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insulin resistance<\/a>, which is important when you\u2019re trying to lose weight. Insulin resistance can cause diabetes and a bunch of other health issues that can affect your weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to eat the flesh of the grapefruit and not just drink the juice. The fiber also helps you shed pounds. If eating a grapefruit plain doesn\u2019t sound enticing, try adding it to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yummly.com\/recipe\/Salad-with-Pink-Grapefruit-_-Avocado-1752520?prm-v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">salad<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8.

It tells you when you\u2019re hungry and when you\u2019re full, or at least it\u2019s supposed to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you haven\u2019t eaten, leptin tells the body to eat, so you do, and vice versa. This system can break down when you get inflammation, especially in the gut, and <strong>you can become leptin resistant<\/strong>, which can cause obesity. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3319208\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greek yogurt helps fight gut inflammation with <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/probiotics-prebiotics-lose-weight-naturally\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">probiotics<\/a> that balance gut flora in a delicious way.

Leafy Greens<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to lose weight, or be a healthy person in general, you need to <strong>get your daily intake of fiber<\/strong>. It\u2019s not just for older folks, kiddos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leafy greens like kale, spinach, Swiss chard, romaine, and arugula are going to give you a healthy dose of fiber, hydration, and nutrients that support weight loss. The problem is that some people don\u2019t like the flavor of leafy greens, so they only juice them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greenjuiceaday.com\/30-green-juice-recipes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Green juices<\/a> are great, but you lose the fiber when you take out the pulp.

It even beats fiber. Upping your protein by 25% has been shown to decrease cravings by 60% and can cause weight loss by a pound a week.

Lemons<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s weird that lemons are so acidic outside the body, but as soon as you eat them or drink lemon juice, they become one of the most <a href=\"http:\/\/www.realfoodforlife.com\/16-health-benefits-of-lemons-the-alkaline-powerfood\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">alkaline forming foods<\/a> out there. They clean your bowels, your liver, kill intestinal parasites, and restore balance to the body\u2019s pH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also <strong>have pectin fiber which helps with hunger cravings<\/strong> and making the body feel fuller.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try squeezing a few lemons into 8 ounces of fresh water and drink daily!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>12. Pumpkin<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People have been eating pumpkin to regulate their bowels for centuries.

Soups<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you noticed that most foods that are good for you, like vegetables and fruits, have a high- water content?
