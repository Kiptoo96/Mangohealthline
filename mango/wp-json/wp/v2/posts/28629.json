There are so many out there that it can be a bit overwhelming just trying to get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are tons of different types of weight loss programs. Literally thousands&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Some provide you with food and completely control every bite you take, while others let you do your own shopping and cooking.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best-selling weight loss programs have had lots of testimonials and&nbsp;lots of people who&nbsp;have had success with them. The key is finding the one that\u2019s right for YOU.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong data-redactor-tag=\"strong\" data-verified=\"redactor\">Just because someone else has had success doesn&#8217;t mean that you will or that the program will be right for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that it&#8217;s not just about what sounds good initially. It&#8217;s more about what you believe you can stick with in the long-term, especially if you <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/lose-weight-weighing-200lbs\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weigh 200 pounds or more<\/a><\/strong> and have a lot of weight to lose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We checked out the top 10 selling weight loss programs<\/strong> and ranked them based on reviews. We weighed in on the pros and cons about what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not so great about each one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These also aren&#8217;t really &#8220;fad&#8221; diets as most of them have been around for YEARS!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Weight Watchers<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This program has been around since the sixties and is the best-selling weight loss program on every list out there. Lots of people have lost weight with it, but there are plenty of stories of diet fails and weight regain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros: <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They <strong>let you eat what you want<\/strong> because the entire system is based on what they call SmartPoints. They\u2019ll give you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellfit.com\/weight-watchers-pointsplus-info-and-reviews-3496193\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nutritional advice<\/a>, but if you really want junk food that falls within their calculations, it\u2019s okay to eat it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program encourages <strong>portion control,<\/strong> which is a big part of their diet. They encourage you to <strong>eat at home and cook so you have more control over what you put in your body.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also have an<strong> incredible support system,<\/strong> with group meetings held both in person and online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They want you to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prevention.com\/weight-loss\/what-happens-when-you-stop-weighing-yourself\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weekly weigh-in<\/a>, which some dieters find discouraging. Some also find that the lack of dietary restrictions makes it too easy to cheat and feel okay about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you are counting points the vast majority of food that you eat, it can have a similar feel to <strong>counting calories<\/strong> for some.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weightwatchers.com\/us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Weight Watchers here.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Jenny Craig<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you hate cooking and <strong>consider your microwave the most important appliance in your home,<\/strong> this is probably the plan for you. Everything you\u2019re going to eat is <a href=\"https:\/\/well.blogs.nytimes.com\/2016\/11\/18\/are-frozen-fruits-and-vegetables-as-nutritious-as-fresh\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prepackaged<\/a> and already portioned out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dieters pick the meals they want for the week online, including snacks, and then you pick them up from the weight loss center.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They take all the guesswork out of eating because they literally do everything for you except heat the food up and shove the fork in your mouth. The total calories per day range from 1200 to 2300, depending on your size and activity level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prevention.com\/weight-loss\/weight-loss-coaches\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weight loss coaches<\/a> you can chat with by phone or in-person that are usually people who\u2019ve successfully traversed the program themselves. They help you achieve your goals and know what it\u2019s like when you slip up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The portions are small, and the calories are usually between 200 to 300 calories each. While the food quality is good, it\u2019s not fresh because it\u2019s frozen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My biggest beef with this program is that it doesn\u2019t include advice on learning how to cook fresh for yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You aren&#8217;t learning how to actually change our bad eating habits and form better relationships with food when literally EVERYTHING is done for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a big concept of our <a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><strong>21-Day Fat Loss Challenge <\/strong><\/a>because this is what helps you KEEP the weight off long-term and make better decisions when you are with friends, dining out, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jenny Craig is also pricey, with food prices from $15 to $26 a day, and that\u2019s not counting membership fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jennycraig.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jenny Craig here.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. The Mayo Clinic Diet<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight loss specialists at the Mayo Clinic designed this long-term weight loss program that\u2019s geared toward helping you <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/build-healthy-habits-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">create healthy habits.<\/a> They want you to have a <strong>sustainable weight management plan<\/strong> that will last your whole life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros: <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is in their <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2wn2kKQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">diet books<\/a> and online, so you don\u2019t need to worry about anyone breathing down your neck about your food choices or getting on a scale. You can <strong>go at your own pace.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mayo Clinic weight loss program is all about <strong>fresh food,<\/strong> and they feel that you can eat as many fresh fruits and vegetables as you like. They\u2019ve created a \u201chealthy weight pyramid\u201d that gives you clear guidelines to make good diet choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no local support, but they\u2019ve got a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.womenshealthmag.com\/weight-loss\/a19976103\/best-weight-loss-apps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weight loss app<\/a> and an online community. You\u2019re on your own with this one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This program has a lot less support and<strong> the go-at-your-own-pace often doesn&#8217;t work for many people.<\/strong> Most people sort of know the &#8220;what to do&#8221; but they need stricter guidance on the &#8220;how to do it.&#8221; If that is you, this may not be ideal for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/weight-loss\/in-depth\/mayo-clinic-diet\/art-20045460\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mayo Clinic Diet here.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/food-delivery-plans.jpg\" alt=\"food delivery plans\" class=\"wp-image-28630\" title=\"food delivery plans\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/food-delivery-plans.jpg 500w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/food-delivery-plans-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/food-delivery-plans-365x243.jpg 365w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/food-delivery-plans-355x236.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Atkins<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you can\u2019t live without your carbs, just blow right past this section and read the next one because Atkins is not your plan.<\/strong> It\u2019s low-carb, high protein and fat only.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if this is you, I can understand that. Cutting out carbohydrates is incredibly important for weight loss, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be a long-term deal. Our <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a><\/strong> includes a <strong>7-day carb cleanse for detoxification and weight loss<\/strong> but it also includes instructions on how to reintroduce carbs back into your diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They have a <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/best-meal-delivery-services\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fresh food meal delivery service<\/a> that\u2019s personalized for your diet and taste needs, as well as snacks, shakes, and <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2jEtZ0K\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">meal bars<\/a> that you can order online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the plans are high fat and high protein, a couple of studies show that the Atkins diet <strong>raises good cholesterol and lowers blood pressure.<\/strong> (<a href=\"https:\/\/health.usnews.com\/best-diet\/atkins-diet\/health-and-nutrition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atkins also has a mobile app and other online support tools to help you reach your goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Health experts really don\u2019t like the Atkins diet, giving it a 2.1 out of 5-star rating. It got high marks for rapid weight loss, but they aren\u2019t buying the nutritional value of the food.

The Golo Diet<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a bit fluffy around the middle, have a hard time losing weight, or have diabetes? The Golo weight loss program might be the best choice for you because it\u2019s geared toward people who are <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/insulin-resistance-and-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insulin resistant<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year membership gets you get supplements, meal plans, shopping lists, recipes, coaching, and support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros: <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They\u2019ve got <strong>three plans to choose from<\/strong>, so you don\u2019t have to marry the program for a year if you don\u2019t like it. Most reviewers also say they really enjoy the recipes and the coaching is great. They also like the price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The supplement they sell is no different from anything else you can get on the market, and people have mixed results with it. Many also feel that the diet information is common sense nutrition and not worth the price of the plan.

The South Beach Diet<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The South Beach weight loss program is like the Atkins Diet\u2019s little sister. It\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/paleoleap.com\/magic-of-low-carb-diets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">low-carb diet<\/a>, but less restrictive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They <strong>deliver fully prepared packaged meals,<\/strong> so you don\u2019t have to worry about portion control or making decisions. They want you to eat lots of little meals a day to get your metabolism rocking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also have a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2rrkm93\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">book on their program<\/a> if you want some further reading before you commit to their plans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They take care of everything for you, including snacks. All you have to do is choose the kinds of foods you like, and they show up on your doorstep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it\u2019s low-carb, they don\u2019t make you give them up completely. The diet is <strong>fairly balanced<\/strong> and is based on sound nutrition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all low carb diets, people usually see rapid weight loss in the beginning. They\u2019ve also got support counselors available by phone when you need help or motivation, and a weight tracker app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The cheapest plan is about 10 bucks a day, which winds up being $300 a month, with limited recipe choices. You\u2019ve got to go to the plan that will cost you almost $400 a month for decent food options, which excludes any food you buy on your own to supplement the plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also relies on packaged meals with few fresh options, which isn&#8217;t always a good idea if you&#8217;re looking to learn how to create your own healthy dishes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.southbeachdiet.com\/home\/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">South Beach Diet here.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Nutrisystem<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This weight loss program is like Jenny Craig, but it\u2019s a little easier on the pocketbook. It provides <strong>meal plans, packaged food, and support.<\/strong> You can order all your food and <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2rr9CaZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">snacks online<\/a>, which makes dieting a lot easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve got<strong> three plan options to choose from<\/strong>, so if you\u2019re broke or on a tight budget, you\u2019ll find something. If you want to customize your meals, it will cost you more, but you can also get an automated plan that\u2019s only about $275 a month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The foods are all <strong>really processed,<\/strong> but most people find them pretty tasty. Still, there\u2019s <strong>concern about their nutritional value<\/strong> from dietitians. Still, they include supplementing their meals with fresh foods in their system, so there is that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cheaper meal plans don\u2019t have as much personalized support as other plans that offer it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nutrisystem.com\/jsps_hmr\/home\/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nutrisystem here.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8.

The program consists of a group of <strong>spiral notebooks, cookbooks, and workout DVDs, and they also have an online option.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The creators of this system have a theory that the<strong> perfect balance of fast carbs, slow carbs, and protein will help your metabolism speed up and burn calories faster.<\/strong> 72% of customers who <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2KJhiOw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">bought the program on Amazon<\/a> gave it three stars and up, so they must be doing something right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The program is based on<strong> educating yourself<\/strong> on what\u2019s going to be most effective for your unique metabolism, and this can lead to long-term results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also don\u2019t tell you not to eat certain kinds of foods, which is a big deal for a lot of people. Mixes of types of carbs and proteins are what matter, so as long as you get the ratio right, you can have the mashed potatoes or pasta for dinner and still lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>People who gave it bad reviews usually did so because the directions were too hard to follow.
