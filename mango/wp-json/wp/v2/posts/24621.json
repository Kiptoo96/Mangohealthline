Nobody likes to carry weight in their face, but unfortunately, many of us do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what you think of your body, it\u2019s easy to flatter your figure with the right clothing styles. If your face flaunts your extra pounds, however, you can\u2019t exactly wear a ski mask for the rest of your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the problem is <strong>genetics<\/strong>. If your face is round or you have a tendency toward a double chin, you may never exhibit hollow cheekbones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there isn\u2019t much you can do to target the fat in a specific area, although you can scroll down to find out how face yoga can help give you a slimmer look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can lose face fat by <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/fastest-way-to-lose-weight-in-3-weeks\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shedding some weight overall<\/span><\/a>, making quality food choices, lifting weights, and avoiding water retention. When all else fails, focus on your skincare for a slimming effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why You Can\u2019t Shrink Just Your Face<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fat is stored throughout your body so that it can be drawn upon for energy. When you burn fat, what your body is actually doing is transforming some of the fat stored in the cells to energy that it can use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The part of the body from which the fat is mobilized is <strong>genetically predetermined.<\/strong> Even though you consider your face fat to be a problem, your DNA might not agree.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you age, you lose <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/collagen-powder-benefits-healthy-skin\/\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collagen<\/a>, which provides that plump appearance. Some anti-aging regimens restore firmness to the skin. That can also make you look a little chubbier in the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the tradeoff is that your skin won\u2019t sag as much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your <strong>facial structure<\/strong> is also responsible for how fat your face appears. If you don\u2019t have a strong jawline, you may look like you have a double chin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are struggling to make your face look thinner, try the tips below. Losing overall weight can help, but I&nbsp;have provided you with some other strategies that you can use if you still want to slim your facial appearance at your target weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Lose Body Fat<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\u2019re at a healthy weight, you probably have more body fat than you need. I say probably because A) most people do and B) you&#8217;re reading this article for a reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.muscleandfitness.com\/nutrition\/lose-fat\/20-tips-shed-body-fat-good-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Muscle &amp; Fitness<\/a><\/span> makes a good point about where your mindset has to be to lose body fat. If you view a fat-loss program as having an endpoint, you\u2019re <strong>more likely to rebound when you reach your goal.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make losing body fat a lifestyle choice, and it will be something that continues throughout your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is something that we advocate heavily in our <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a><\/span>. &nbsp;Some of the best feedback we get from our clients is how they were able to <strong>modify the diet to fit their needs in the long-term.<\/strong> &nbsp;You can read more about it at the end of the article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other ways to lose body fat are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Drink more water<\/strong> \u2013 You\u2019ll help your cells mobilize the fat that needs to be burned. &nbsp;We recommend 100 ounces a day!<\/li><li><strong>Create a calorie deficit<\/strong> \u2013 Eat fewer calories than you burn.<\/li><li><strong>Eat fewer sugars and starchy foods<\/strong> \u2013 Consuming too many sugars in one sitting gives your body more energy than it needs, leaving excess energy to be stored as fat.<\/li><li><strong>Cycle your carbs<\/strong> \u2013 Limit your carb intake on rest days. Eat carbs to fuel up on days that you\u2019re working out.<\/li><li><strong>Drink black coffee<\/strong> \u2013 Increased energy, fat burning, and metabolism.

Lift Weights<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/weights-min-e1601543281231.jpg\" alt=\"colorful weights\" class=\"wp-image-29541\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>While we\u2019re on the subject of muscle, let\u2019s talk about how <strong>increasing muscle mass can help your body burn fat.<\/strong> Women\u2019s Health Mag references a Penn State study that found that people who do cardio and strength-training exercises may lose the same amount of weight, but the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.womenshealthmag.com\/fitness\/weight-exercises-women\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">strength trainers lose more fat<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Penn State researchers go further to say that starting in early middle age, we lose six to seven pounds of muscle every ten years. This allows the fat to creep on and make your face look rounder (<a href=\"http:\/\/news.psu.edu\/story\/141021\/1995\/06\/01\/research\/strong-medicine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you lift weights, you will help your body look slimmer instead of just shedding pounds. You will also be more likely to keep the weight off.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s important if you\u2019re concerned about your facial appearance. If you yo-yo diet, the skin on your face is more likely to sag as you quickly lose and gain weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Practice Face Yoga<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Vb_xcKcYs0Q\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>Face yoga and other facial exercises are designed to strengthen the muscles in and around the face, creating a <strong>slimmer appearance.<\/strong> &nbsp; One exercise to tone your face involves smiling as widely as you can with your lips closed. Hold the smile for two seconds before releasing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do 25 repetitions per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To tone your jawline, tilt your head back and look at the ceiling. Pucker your lips into a kissing position and hold for 5 seconds. Return to a neutral position before repeating the exercise. Do 5 repetitions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get rid of a double chin, roll your head around in a clockwise motion 5 times, then roll it around counterclockwise 5 times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Because the muscles in your face are smaller than many of the muscles in your body, you should see results relatively quickly.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Practice Healthy Skin Care<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If all else fails, <strong>treat your skin well to make it glow<\/strong> and put your best face forward. Cleanse it gently at night to remove environmental residue, and <strong>moisturize it regularly.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Exfoliating<\/strong> with some sugar mixed with coconut oil can slough off dead skin cells and reveal brighter skin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you really want to accentuate your facial structure, practice using lighter and darker shades of makeup to contour your face. Adding darker tones to the areas that naturally fall into shadow, like under your cheekbones and below the jawline, can have an immediate slimming effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Make Quality Food Choices<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What you eat can affect the way your face looks. Processed food can contain more sodium than you expect, leaving you looking puffy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chemically processed foods are also often high in sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Researchers have found that <strong>eating too much sugar can dramatically lower your metabolism <\/strong>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23594708\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s more, <strong>sugar can cause inflammation.<\/strong> Inflammation can manifest itself as redness, puffiness or acne on the face, adding more issues to part of your body that you may already consider a problem area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If puffiness is often a problem, make sure that you\u2019re <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/drinking-water-lose-weight\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drinking enough water<\/a><\/span> to flush out toxins and swelling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to make better food choices is to <strong>eat more vegetables.<\/strong> Veggies have fewer calories and more nutrients than many other foods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most vegetables contain a nutrient or antioxidant that\u2019s beneficial for your skin health. If you\u2019re not full after eating a healthy meal of quality protein and vegetables, chances are you need to up your veggie intake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of protein, eating enough of the stuff can help you feel more satisfied from a meal. It also prevents your body from using your own muscle as energy as it burns off fat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if all else fails, give our <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/21dayfatlosschallenge.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">21-Day Fat Loss Challenge<\/a><\/span> a try.
