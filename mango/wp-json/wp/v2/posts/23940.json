You might even know a thing or two about what foods are good for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that there are so many so-called experts out there that we have no idea where you might have gotten your information from.

Microwave Popcorn<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people think of popcorn as a health food. One cup of the crunchy snack contains only 30 calories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same amount also contains 1 gram of protein and 1.2 grams of fiber, making it satisfying and relatively safe for your waistline. &nbsp;It also just &#8220;feels light,&#8221; right? &nbsp;So <strong>it&#8217;s something that you don&#8217;t feel that eater&#8217;s remorse from.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However,&nbsp;microwave popcorn truly can wreak havoc on your system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s not just the partially hydrogenated soybean oil, artificial flavor, artificial color and chemical preservatives in microwave popcorn that can harm your health. The bag that most types of microwave popcorn come in is coated with toxic perfluorooctanoic acid.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca#concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Environmental Protection Agency<\/a><\/span>, this chemical is a <strong>carcinogen<\/strong> and has been linked to <strong>cancer<\/strong>. It can be harmful to your health if you\u2019re eating the popcorn, and it\u2019s not good for everyone else in your environment to breathe in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just think of that <strong>awful yellow color<\/strong> on your popcorn that you associate with &#8220;yummy, movie theater butter.&#8221; &nbsp;<strong>It isn&#8217;t real butter.<\/strong> &nbsp;At all. &nbsp;Note the words &#8220;<em>artificial flavor<\/em>&#8221; AND &#8220;<em>artificial color<\/em>&#8221; in the above description. &nbsp;There&#8217;s nothing real about that stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make your own popcorn using <strong>organic, non-GMO kernels and an air popper or the old standby\u2014your stove.<\/strong> &nbsp;We love it with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/coconut-oil-for-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">organic, unrefined coconut oil<\/a><\/span> and sea salt!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use all kinds of healthy and natural additives like garlic, extra virgin olive oil, Cajun seasoning, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B002863BIW\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fitincol-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B002863BIW&amp;linkId=f824c22ffe09af6dcb538126dbb99b6f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">nutritional yeast<\/a><\/span> if you&#8217;re into the cheese flavoring (which is also loaded with nutrients!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Fruit Juice<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"219\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/orange-juice-causes-weight-gain-219x300.jpg\" alt=\"orange juice is one of the foods you should never eat\" class=\"wp-image-23951\" title=\"orange juice is one of the foods you should never eat\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/orange-juice-causes-weight-gain-219x300.jpg 219w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/orange-juice-causes-weight-gain-200x274.jpg 200w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/orange-juice-causes-weight-gain.jpg 365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Fruit is healthy, right? Sure; <strong>fruit contains nutrients, vitamins, and fiber.<\/strong> &nbsp;However, when it is processed into juice, it becomes a <strong>sugar-laden beverage with little nutritional value.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it can be tempting to down juice that claims to provide three servings of fruits and vegetables in one glass, <strong>it\u2019s not the same as eating those foods in their natural forms.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fruit contains a lot of sugar (and most of that is <strong>ADDED sugar<\/strong>, not naturally occurring sugar). If you eat four oranges, you take in that sugar, but you also get the<strong> added fiber that helps balance out that sugar.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fiber keeps you full. According to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/psychologyofeating.com\/psychobiology-chewing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Psychology of Eating<\/a><\/span>, the act of chewing makes you feel more satisfied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Swallowing four oranges in the form of juice may provide you with some vitamin C, but the sugar and lack of chewing may lead you to crave more sweet treats.<\/strong> &nbsp;It also contains preservatives to make it shelf-friendly. &nbsp;Stick to eating whole oranges with your breakfast!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Margarine<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another remnant of the fake-health-food craze of the \u201880s and \u201890s, margarine is made of<strong> hydrogenated fats.<\/strong> &nbsp;Even most peanut butters aren&#8217;t being made with hydrogenated oils anymore because of the trend towards natural peanut butters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/draxe.com\/health-foods-you-should-never-eat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">This article by Dr. Axe<\/a><\/span> explains how these trans fats are more harmful than natural saturated fats for your cardiovascular health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Margarine is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/naturalsociety.com\/butter-vs-margarine-big-fat-butter-lie\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">almost as far from a natural substance<\/a><\/span> as you can get. It has <strong>zero&nbsp;nutritional value.<\/strong> &nbsp;<em><strong>Why would we&nbsp;ever want to put something in our&nbsp;bodies that has ZERO nutritional value? What a waste!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, <strong>organic and grass-fed butter<\/strong> from pastured cows contains beneficial nutrients like conjugated lineic acid, butyric acid, vitamin K2, vitamin A, vitamin D and vitamin E.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And P.S. grass-fed butter is <strong>only marginally more expensive than regular butter!<\/strong> &nbsp;The price has gone down tremendously thanks to recent health trends and consumer demand for better ingredients! &nbsp;Look for it at your local grocery store!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Artificial Sweeteners<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"233\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/avoid-artificial-sweeteners-at-all-costs-233x300.jpg\" alt=\"avoid artificial sweeteners at all costs\" class=\"wp-image-23953\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/avoid-artificial-sweeteners-at-all-costs-233x300.jpg 233w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/avoid-artificial-sweeteners-at-all-costs-213x274.jpg 213w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/avoid-artificial-sweeteners-at-all-costs.jpg 388w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though artificial sweeteners are by definition <strong>unnatural<\/strong>, many people believe that <strong>because they are so readily&nbsp;available for human consumption, they must not be bad for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who are addicted to sugar think that they\u2019ll be healthier if they swap that sugar for artificial sweeteners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, <em>how can zero calories NOT be healthy, right?<\/em> &nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Wrong<\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eating too much sugar is linked to inflammation, obesity, and diabetes.<\/strong> However, research shows that artificial sweeteners can cause diabetes by <strong>messing with your intestinal flora <\/strong>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/pdf\/nature13793.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scientists also say that artificial sweeteners are associated with certain types of <strong>cancer, allergies, brain tumors, high blood pressure, headaches, seizures, and obesity <\/strong>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3198517\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it seems like you\u2019d be more likely to stick to a healthy eating plan if you could just trade in your favorite dessert for a similar-tasting, low-sugar replacement, that\u2019s not necessarily the case. It\u2019s also not necessarily healthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that <strong>artificial is just a fancy word for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">FAKE<\/span>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Staying away from the highly processed foods<\/strong> that are made with artificial sweeteners as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/quit-your-sugar-addiction\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>cutting out sugar from your diet<\/strong><\/a> may ultimately be the best way to cure your cravings for sugar and carbs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Low-Fat, Deluxe-Flavor Yogurt<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, almost every brand of yogurt offers fancy flavors, like key lime pie and mint chocolate chip. Don\u2019t be fooled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Even the commercials show you these fancy little yogurts being eaten by slim women talking about how healthy they are now that it&#8217;s a staple in their lives.<\/em> &nbsp;They show you these average, good-looking moms in their beautiful brightly lit kitchen with their cute workout clothes on&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The truth is that many of these yogurts are no healthier for you than ice cream.<\/strong> One 6-ounce container of Yoplait strawberry yogurt contains 26 grams of sugar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The American Heart Association recommends that adults consume only <strong>36 grams of sugar per day<\/strong>. If you do enjoy yogurt, switch to Greek varieties, which have more 2-3x more protein and typically contain far less&nbsp;sugar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Low-Carb Meal Replacements or Energy Bars<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it seems convenient to pack in plenty of protein and other nutrients by eating an energy bar, these products are often <strong>highly processed<\/strong> and <strong>lack the benefits that real foods provide.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many energy bars are just <strong>re-branded candy bars.<\/strong> &nbsp;They have to add dried fruit, processed peanut butter, and chocolate to them to make them taste good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a protein pick-me-up, go for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B006OC444Q\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fitincol-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B006OC444Q&amp;linkId=0370d4d41ec1f7535351c00689a5b777\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">protein powder<\/a><\/span> instead. &nbsp;You can mix with it unsweetened nut milk such as almond, cashew, or coconut, or even just water. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a great option to take with you on the go!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Fake Coffee Drinks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"203\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/never-eat-blended-coffee-drinks-203x300.jpg\" alt=\"blended coffee drinks are foods you should never eat\" class=\"wp-image-23949\" title=\"blended coffee drinks are foods you should never eat\" srcset=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/never-eat-blended-coffee-drinks-203x300.jpg 203w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/never-eat-blended-coffee-drinks-185x274.jpg 185w, https:\/\/avocadu.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/never-eat-blended-coffee-drinks.jpg 338w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Real lattes, cappuccinos, and iced coffee are made from brewed coffee and some milk. There is a lot of evidence that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/10-proven-health-benefits-of-coffee\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">real coffee<\/a><\/span> is good for your health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many beverages sold at coffee shops or in the grocery stores aren\u2019t coffee at all. A frappuccino type of blended drink is usually made of a <strong>processed base,<\/strong> sometimes a few pumps of <strong>concentrated coffee syrup, and other artificial flavorings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, because I worked at 3 different coffee shops in college for 3 years!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on what you add to your drink, you may be consuming caramel coloring, which has been linked with thyroid, lung, and liver cancer. Yikes!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re also drinking <strong>high-fructose corn syrup,<\/strong> mono- and di-glycerides, which are actually trans-fatty acids and a ton of refined sugar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starbucks isn\u2019t the only culprit. McDonald\u2019s vanilla iced coffee is filled with artificial chemicals, too. Especially if a coffee drink contains nondairy creamer or flavored syrups, you might want to stay away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stick to <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/iced-coffee-protein-shake-recipes-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">making them yourself at home<\/a> with ingredients like coffee, unsweetened nondairy milk, protein powder, cinnamon, and cacao powder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Gluten-Free Processed Foods<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Just because a food is gluten-free doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthy.<\/strong> Many gluten-free snack and dessert alternatives are <strong>highly processed.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They may contain <strong>high levels of sugar, oils that aren\u2019t great for your health, and refined grains.<\/strong> Gluten-free packaged food may not contain any more nutrients than a slice of Wonder Bread.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another clue to the dangers of &#8220;gluten-free&#8221; on foods is that they are widely used as a marketing ploy to get you to think a product is healthier than it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m looking at my bag of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B01G0S3Y44\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thehealthnerd-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01G0S3Y44&amp;linkId=48a3942661f4bdffb25e8f68a8bfc6db\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">matcha green tea powder<\/a><\/span> right now and smirking that it says &#8220;gluten-free&#8221; on the packaging. &nbsp;It&#8217;s TEA LEAVES! Of course, it&#8217;s gluten-free!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see this randomly on fruits and vegetables and all sorts of things that are OBVIOUSLY gluten-free. <strong>&nbsp;Food manufacturers want to&nbsp;make you feel as good and comfortable as possible with their product.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence why everything is labeled &#8220;<em><strong>ALL<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp;<em><strong>NATURAL<\/strong><\/em>&#8221; these days. &nbsp;That is because <strong>the USDA has not issued any definition at all on the word &#8220;natural;&#8221; therefore anyone can slap that on their labels. &nbsp;It&#8217;s completely <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">meaningless<\/span>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re trying to avoid gluten, focus on<strong> changing your mindset about&nbsp;convenience foods,<\/strong> and you may stop reaching for sandwiches, crackers, and pretzels altogether for more nutritious options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Chef Boyardee<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This canned pasta has its own flavor that just doesn\u2019t taste like homemade. The beef ravioli variety contains <strong>caramel coloring, soybean oil, yeast extract, and high fructose corn syrup.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeast extract contains glutamic acid, a problematic compound that makes up MSG. According to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.truthinlabeling.org\/presentregulations.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Truth in Labeling<\/a><\/span>, food manufacturers don\u2019t have to list it as an ingredient if it\u2019s found within other incorporated ingredients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glutamic acid has been associated with many adverse health reactions, including <strong>a headache, fatigue and breathing difficulties.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please do not eat this or feed it to your children!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>10. Muffins<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This tricky food can pack a whopping number of calories in one sweet, convenient package. Muffins aren\u2019t the enemy, but you should be aware that they are not your friend, either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are <strong>WAY too convenient<\/strong> for breakfast or a quick snack, which makes it nearly impossible to say no to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many commercial muffins contain <strong>harmful chemicals.<\/strong> Even if you make <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/healthy-go-to-breakfast-recipes\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all-natural muffins<\/a> at home, have you ever calculated the number of calories in one serving?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can often cut down on the amount of sugar that a muffin recipe calls for. Still, the average homemade muffin still contains about 250 calories, and they go&nbsp;down way too easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You could eat three eggs and a few cups of greens for the same number of calories and consume more nutrients and less sugar.
