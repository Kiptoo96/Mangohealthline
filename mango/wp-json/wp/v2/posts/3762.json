This mineral is key for growth, building muscles, the transmission of nerve impulses, heart activity, etc. It also helps to prevent brittle teeth, hair loss, and runny noses.<\/li><li><strong>Rich in acetic acid.<\/strong> This acid is said to slow the digestion of starch, which can help to lower the rise in glucose that commonly occurs after meals.<\/li><li><strong>Rich in ash,<\/strong> which gives ACV its alkaline property. This aids your body in maintaining proper pH levels for a healthy alkaline state. (It is particularly important if you drink a lot of coffee or wine.)<\/li><li><strong>Rich in malic acid,<\/strong> which gives ACV its antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal properties<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How does apple cider vinegar help you lose weight?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Appetite Suppressant<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition revealed that<strong> those that&nbsp;consumed&nbsp;apple cider vinegar with a meal reported feeling&nbsp;2x fuller&nbsp;than those that&nbsp;ate meals without it.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been our&nbsp;experience as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consuming apple cider vinegar does a terrific job at suppressing my appetite, especially when we&nbsp;consume it around that 2-3:00 slump when we&#8217;re&nbsp;feeling tempted to snack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Controls Blood Sugar and Insulin Levels<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2Fvb5SJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">Apple cider vinegar<\/a> preven<\/strong>ts those crazy blood sugar spikes and crashes you feel after eating a filling meal. According to the same study conducted above, blood sugar levels were much lower when a meal was consumed with apple cider vinegar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is great for a few reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, it gives you <strong>sustained energy after you eat<\/strong> and keeps your blood sugar from dipping too low. This will<strong> help keep you from binge eating.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, it will prevent a large insulin spike after meals, which causes fat storage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Prevents Fat Accumulation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple cider vinegar stimulates your metabolism in a way that helps you <strong>burn fat faster.<\/strong> Scientists have concluded that consumption of acetic acid (what\u2019s in apple cider vinegar) <strong>blocks fat accumulation.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see how this works 2x to your advantage. Not only does it help you burn fat quicker, but it also blocks fat from storing on your body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Detoxifies the Body<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We all carry around with us a host of toxins received from our environment and our diets. The good thing is that apple cider vinegar helps <strong>flush those toxins from the body<\/strong> with a variety of nutrients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, ACV&nbsp;latches onto these toxins and <strong>helps pull them down your digestive tract.<\/strong> Which is a great lead into the next point\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Helps Digestive system<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Being rich in acetic acid, ash, and malic acid makes apple cider vinegar a <strong>powerhouse for your digestive system.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The compounds listed above help you better absorb and use the nutrients you eat while discarding the remains. You want to get the FULL benefit from anything healthy you eat, and apple cider vinegar will help you do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Other Common Questions About Apple Cider Vinegar<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>When should&nbsp;I drink apple cider vinegar?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know exactly how awesome it is, let\u2019s talk about how EXACTLY you need to use it to lose weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the 2 best strategic times to drink apple cider vinegar:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Drink a glass 30 minutes before your meals.<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the perfect time to enhance your digestion and at the same time reduce your appetite, which are both excellent for weight loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Drink a glass when you feel like breaking your diet.<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>When you feel those cravings coming on, make yourself a glass of ACV&nbsp;water for relief! It\u2019s really great for that middle of the day break between lunch and dinner when those chip\/candy cravings come on. You can keep a bottle with you at work to help prevent binge eating!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How often should I drink it?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re just starting out, take it slow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try one glass on your first day and see how you do. The next day, you can add another until&nbsp;you work yourself up to 3 glasses a day maximum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any more than that is overkill and will hinder the effectiveness of the drink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How much should I drink?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the&nbsp;first glass on your first day, try 1 tablespoon with 8oz of water (a cup).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can work your way up to 2 tablespoons per cup overtime, but the taste may take some getting used to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, everybody is a little bit different, so take this advice with a grain of salt.
