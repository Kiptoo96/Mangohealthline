Researchers have also found that caffeine can speed up your metabolism. (<a href=\"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10068-010-0151-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/49\/1\/44.long\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you\u2019re burning calories at a higher rate and burning fat for fuel, you\u2019re more likely to lose weight.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That cup of coffee that you drink in the morning may be doing more for than you think. However, if you load it up with sugar, artificial flavors and cream, you\u2019re doing yourself a disservice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to enjoy your coffee is in a protein shake. The <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2pUc9Zi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener\">protein powder<\/a>&nbsp;will help you feel full and fuel your body while the coffee delivers weight-loss benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Problem with Smoothies<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When many people make smoothies, they load them with sugar. Even though bananas, berries and other fruits are natural, they contain lots of carbs.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people eat more fruit than necessary when they\u2019re in a smoothie. One study found that when you drink a smoothie that\u2019s filled with fruit, you end up consuming 12 percent more calories (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/v31\/n11\/full\/0803667a.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinking these calories can cause your body to feel less satisfied because you didn&#8217;t spend the time to chew that fruit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you pack carbs into a blended drink and gulp them down, they can cause your blood sugar to spike. If you use juice as the liquid in your smoothie, you could be consuming as much sugar as is in a soda. Yikes!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Carbs aren\u2019t the devil, but some people don&#8217;t process them as well as others.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should&nbsp;generally stick to a higher carb diet on days that you workout intensely, and it may be a good idea to avoid them entirely if you don&#8217;t work out often (or ever).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using coffee instead of the fruit juice can have TONS of <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/10-proven-health-benefits-of-coffee\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">added benefits for your health!<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid sugar-laden frozen beverages that you find at most coffee shops, and opt for a healthier version at home!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need is any decent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.littlecoffeeplace.com\/grind-and-brew-coffee-makers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">coffee maker<\/a> and a couple of go-to recipes and you will be ready to go!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Benefits of Adding Coffee to A Protein Shake<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Research shows that coffee increases adrenaline levels in the body. As adrenaline courses through your bloodstream, it tells fat tissues to release fat. Your body can then use this fat for energy (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8201901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies have also found that your body temperature increases after you drink caffeine, and so does your metabolic rate (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7486839\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lean people may have up to a 29 percent increase in their metabolic rate after consuming caffeine. If you\u2019re already at a healthy weight, drinking coffee with your protein powder can help you stay that way (<a href=\"http:\/\/ajpendo.physiology.org\/content\/269\/4\/E671.short\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Caffeine can also improve athletic performance.<\/strong> If you\u2019re already drinking a shake before you go to the gym, consider adding some coffee to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caffeine can make you exercise more intensely without perceiving that you\u2019re working that hard, according to research. That means that <strong>you may be able to burn more calories in less time when you work out <\/strong>(<a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1600-0838.2005.00445.x\/abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/effects-of-coffee-on-body\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Effects of Coffee on the Body<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Else Should You Add to A Protein Shake?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you aren&#8217;t packing your protein shake with fruit, what should you add to it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with the liquid, which in this case is iced coffee.
