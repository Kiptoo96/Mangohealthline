This is because <strong>our ancestors weren&#8217;t eating lean, 98% fat-free chicken breasts for dinner every night.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were consuming as much of the animal as they could (including tendons, ligaments, etc.) because food was often scarce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research indicates that&nbsp;<strong>collagen offers restorative effects for <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/daily-juicing-recipe-healthy-skin\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aging skin <\/a><\/strong>that was previously only available via injection or permanent surgery, and without side effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prevention.com\/eatclean\/collagen-supplements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stephanie Eckelkamp<\/a> at Prevention shared her personal experience with giving collagen powder a try. Her preliminary research included a study that showed women experienced a <strong>20% reduction in the visibility of their wrinkles.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now guys, I can&#8217;t attest to that claim personally. I immediately think of those skin creams claiming the same, and many of them don&#8217;t seem to work. But I do still believe that there are too many collagen powder benefits&nbsp;to ignore giving it a try!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another perk that inspired Stephanie to test drive of collagen was the research that claims daily supplementation can relieve knee pain for osteoarthritis patients, and she suffered from ongoing knee discomfort before trying collagen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephanie reported that she experienced a few benefits during her trial with the powder, including feeling full longer due to the heaping amount of protein included in each serving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See what I mean about the protein?? &#8211; It&#8217;s a great change-up with bonus benefits if you are tired of <a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/use-whey-protein-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>whey protein<\/strong><\/a> or the usual meat sources.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also noticed that her <strong>previously creaky knees quieted down substantially and that her gut seemed to appreciate the healing benefits of the protein-rich substance as well.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Gut health, too!?
