Cold cut roll-ups<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since eating more protein is the name of the game when you\u2019re trying to lose weight, you should have some pre-sliced meats on hand. &nbsp;<strong>Grab a couple of slices, along with some veggies, and get rolling!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex and I&nbsp;like to have thinly sliced cucumbers in the fridge (prep them once or twice a week) so we can get snacking ASAP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Olives<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re finding it difficult to find flavorful whole foods that are low-carb, olives just might be your new best friend. Olives come in a bunch of different varieties (think: flavors) that can <strong>spice up your snacking.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jarred or canned olives are easy to buy and store long-term, so you can plan ahead to always have them on-hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelsey from <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cookingispun.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CookingIsPun.com<\/a><\/span> also recommends olives in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fPbys9jSvNw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">her video<\/a><\/span> on low carb travel snacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

Half of an avocado<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve never eaten avocado with a little salt sprinkled on it, you\u2019re missing out! This creamy, just slightly salty snack is really satisfying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like spinach, avocados can supply you with a ton of nutrition for little calories or carbs. You can even cut down on sugar by substituting avocado for a banana in many smoothie recipes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Hard-boiled eggs<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another prep-ahead snack that can save you when you\u2019re starving. Boil a dozen eggs over the weekend, then <strong>store them in the fridge for weekday snacking.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since eggs are a solid source of protein, they\u2019re perfect for a weight loss diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9.

Beef jerky<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Or should I&nbsp;say, \u201cBEEF JERKY!\u201d This should probably be at the top of the list, but I&nbsp;thought veggies should come first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an easy snack that you can get almost anywhere!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just make sure to <strong>avoid the \u201cflavored\u201d jerky<\/strong> as it often is loaded with sugar to enhance the taste. You can also experiment try turkey jerky as well because it usually has less sugar and calories per serving (also really yummy)!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Tip: <\/strong>All food is more satisfying if it tastes good. Learn to use <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/avocadu.com\/13-best-herbs-spices-weight-loss\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">herbs and spices<\/a><\/span> to enhance the flavors of low-carb foods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many herbs and spices have healthy and weight-loss benefits (think: cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and mustard seed).
