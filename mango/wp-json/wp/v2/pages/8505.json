Imagine if only \u00bd of 1% of kids graduated high school?? That\u2019s an outright problem, not a minor issue. Something is VERY wrong with the health and wellness industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing more research and from our own personal experience, we noticed some strange things. Things in both the plant-eating community and amongst the carnivores. Maybe some of these will resonate with you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>So many myths, scams, and outright lies<\/strong> exist that people have just become completely immune to the meaning of good health and wellness. Some have even become resigned to the \u201cfact\u201d that they can never be healthy and should just \u201caccept\u201d being overweight and tired. \ud83d\ude41<\/li><li>People have become <strong>sanctimonious<\/strong> about their own beliefs about nutrition. We all have that Facebook Warrior friend droning on and on about diet X and how amazing it is, blindly following every word preached and ignoring any counter-evidence or ideas opposed to their viewpoint.<\/li><li>There are so many <strong>unhealthy \u201chealthy\u201d recipes<\/strong> out there to make you feel better about yourself for eating crap food. Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies. Paleo Ice Cream. Atkins Pumpkin Pies\u2026 These things are really just confusing people more than they are helping.<\/li><li>People are, in general, just <strong>confused about how to lose weight,<\/strong> yet there is more information out there than ever before.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As we delved further into the rabbit hole of health and wellness, we learned a few things that became the principles of this website: <h3><strong>Principle 1: We believe that your <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">diet<\/span> determines most of your health and well-being.<\/strong><\/h3> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When most people have a medical issue like dry skin, they usually turn to a moisturizer to solve the problem. While moisturizers are great, this is still the wrong \u201cpill fix\u201d mentality. The right question one should ask is <em>\u201cWHY do I have dry skin?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maybe your skin is dry because you are drinking virtually 0 cups of water a day!<\/em> \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Did you ever think that maybe those persistent headaches you get are not just random, but actually caused by a food intolerance?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just some of the many examples why\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Food is medicine.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, food can\u2019t cure everything, but you\u2019d be damn surprised by how many \u201cproblems\u201d people currently have and how their diet affects (and sometimes causes) them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your health, wellness, and beauty should not be a never-ending cycle of putting on bandages to cover things up. If you eat healthy on the inside, you will radiate on the outside.<\/strong> <h3><strong>Principle 2. We believe in quality over quantity.<\/strong><\/h3> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counting calories is mundane, boring, and most people are terrible at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re not big fans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you focus on eating lots of high-quality nutritious foods, getting in under your calories becomes almost automatic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just about the calories, it\u2019s what each of those calories is doing for you! <h3><strong>Principle 3. We believe that there is no one-size-fits-all diet.<\/strong><\/h3> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you eat should be determined by your individual goals, tolerances, and intolerances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people have celiac disease and cannot process gluten, and some people can. Having a one-size \u201ccure-all\u201d diet does not make any sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How you eat should also depend on your individual goals.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The optimal diet for weight loss is different than the optimal diet for skin health. The optimal diet for muscle gain is different for both of those.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you eat should be determined by your goals as much as your individual needs and problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avocadu
